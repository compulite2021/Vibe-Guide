# Programming Basics

This chapter deals with the fundamentals of building stage looks in the editor.

**The following is covered in this chapter:**

- [8.1. Editor](#Editor-8.1.)
- [8.2. Editor Tools](#EditorTools-8.2.)
- [8.3. Working with Fixtures](#WorkingwithFixtures-8.3.)
- [8.4. Groups](#Groups-8.4.)
- [8.5. Undo](#Undo-8.5.)


## Editor {#Editor-8.1.}

Editor Basics:

-   [8.1.1. What is the Editor](#what-is-the-editor-8.1.1.)
-   [8.1.2. Blind Editor](#blind-editor-8.1.2.)

###  What is the Editor {#what-is-the-editor-8.1.1.}

All manual parameter modification occurs in the **EDITOR**. (Programmer in some other consoles). The **Live Displays** show all values from **both** Controller outputs (Playbacks or Executors on some consoles) and fixtures in the Editor. Color coding is used to distinguish between values coming from the controllers and values in the **EDITOR**.

**Home a fixture in the Editor:**

-   [FIXTURE] [#] [HOME]
    
**Home a fixture parameter in the Editor:**

-   [FIXTURE] [#] {BANK} {PARAMETER} [HOME]
    

**Release a fixture in the Editor:**

-   [FIXTURE] [#] RELEASE]
    

**Release a fixture parameter in the Editor:**

-   [FIXTURE] [#] {BANK} {PARAMETER} [RELEASE]
    

**Reset (Clear) the Editor:**

-   Press [RESET] key
    

**Reset (Clear) the Editor and clear the selection:**

-   Press [VIBE] + [RESET]

### Blind Editor {#blind-editor-8.1.2.}

The Blind Editor is used to create or modify objects without outputting values to the stage

Vibe has two Blind Editor behaviors:

1.  Blind acts as a discrete editor separate from the live editor
    
2. Blind emulates the behavior of single editor consoles where the main editors output is just disabled
    

**To build a new cue in the Blind Editor:**

1.  Press [Blind] key flashes **<span style="color:Gold">yellow</span>** and the Command Line turns **<mark>yellow</mark>**.
    
2.  Program values using the Live Display for reference - no values will be outputted to the stage
    
3.  Store objects as usual - See also:
    

-   [8.4. Creating and Applying Groups](#Groups-8.4.) 
    
-   [9.3. Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers](#StoringCuesandScenesDirectlytoControllers-9.3.)
    
-   [9.5. Storing Cues to the Master Controller](#StoringCuestotheMasterController-9.5.)
    
-   [9.6. Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller](#StoringQlistCuestoanyController-9.6.)
    
-   [11.2. Store and Modify Bank Libraries](#StoreandModifyBankLibraries-11.2.)
    

**To edit a cue in the Blind Editor:**

1. Press [Blind] - key flashes **<span style="color:Gold">yellow</span>** and the Command Line turns **<mark>yellow</mark>**.
    
2.  Press [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [EDIT] - [UPDATE] flashes <span style="color:Red">red</span>.
    
3. Make modifications to the cue
    
4. Press [UPDATE] to complete the sequence
    

**To emulate single editor blind:**

1. Press [VIBE]+[BLIND] - Copies the Live Editor contents to the Blind Editor
    
2. Toggle [VIBE ]+[BLIND] - Copies the contents of the Blind Editor to the Live Editor (The original contents stay in the Blind Editor

## Editor Tools {#EditorTools-8.2.}

**Editor Tools:**

-   [8.2.1. Selections Tools](#selections-tools-8.2.1.)
-   [8.2.2. Transpose](#Transpose-8.2.2.)
-   [8.2.3. Order and Selection](#Order and Selection-8.2.3.)
-   [8.2.4. Fan Mode](#fan-mode-8.2.4.)
-   [8.2.5. Highlight Mode](#highlight-mode-8.2.5.)
-   [8.2.6. Lowlight Mode](#lowlight-mode-8.2.6.)
-   [8.2.7. Remainder Dim {Rem Dim}](#remainder-dim-rem-dim-8.2.7.)
-   [8.2.8 Home Scene](#home-scene-8.2.8)

### Selections Tools {#selections-tools-8.2.1.}

Currently, Vibe has basic Selection Tools. Advanced tools are under development.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F9gX5fSd003KSW9SXkmvY%2F9.2.1.webp?alt=media&token=2cf874a1-a246-4be6-b36b-b8b1b3ec6fb9)

-   {ODDS} - Absolute odd number in the range
    
-   {Evens} - Absolute even numbers in the range
    
-   {2/1} - Grouping of 2 starting at the first fixture of the range (Relative odd numbers)
    
-   {2/2} - Grouping of 2 starting at the second fixture of the range (relative even numbers)
    
-   {3/1} - Grouping of 3 starting at the first fixture of the range
    
-   {4/1} - Grouping of 4 starting at the first fixture of the range
    
-   **{/}** - Used as a separator. **Groupings of #/# Start fixture of the grouping**
    
-   **E.g. -**  *[Fixture] [1] [⟶ ] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [1] - would select fixtures 1,4,7,10,13 (as soon as the {/} is pressed **EVERY 3/1** will be displayed on the command line).*
    

*[Fixture] [1] [⟶ ] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [2] - would select fixtures 2,5,8,11,14 (as soon as the {/} is pressed **EVERY 3/2** will be displayed on the command line).*

### Transpose {#Transpose-8.2.2.}

Transpose is accessed from the Editor Toolbar. It is used to reorder fixture selection based on a specified offset. This is particularly useful in creating interesting effects and fanning.

**E.g. 1:**

*-   Fixture 1 ⟶  12 {Transpose} 2 [ENTER] = 1+3+5+7+9+11+2+4+6+8+10+12*
    

**E.g. 2:**

*-   Fixture 1 ⟶  12 {Transpose} 3 [ENTER] = 1+4+7+10+2+5+8+11+3+6+9+12*
    

**E.g. 3:**

*-   Fixture 1⟶ 12 {Transpose} 4 [ENTER] = 1+5+9+2+6+10+3+7+11+4+8+12*

### Order and Selection {#Order and Selection-8.2.3.}

**Order**

The Order button allows to make changes to the fixtures' selection order.

4.  Select a number under the Block Size header.
    
5. Tap the {Spread} icon. The fixture columns will expand to show the new fixture order.
    
6.  If desired make further order changes under the Offset Header and tap {offset} icon.
    
7.  Make further modifications or reset the selection with the {Reset} {Invert} {transpose} and {Invert Columns} keys.
    
8. Once finished, exit the pop-up by pressing [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png) or [ENTER].
    
9.   Open the Advanced Effects editor and program the desired effect.
    

-   See: [12.3. Advanced Effects Editor](#AdvancedEffectsEditor-12.3.)
    

> Simple Block and Sub Block groupings may be created within both Effects Editors. The pattern is for advanced blocks and groupings

### Fan Mode {#fan-mode-8.2.4.}

**Vibe has two methods to fan fixture parameters:**

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FRCZsSlnmcSFafQEwMVRY%2F9.2.4.webp?alt=media&token=2157359e-bd73-4d57-b692-0826758d2620)

1.  Using the [Fan] key and interface.
    
2.  Using keypad syntax.
    

See: [8.3.7. Fixture Selection (Detailed)](#Fixture-Selection-Detailed-8.3.7)

**Using [Fan] Mode:**

1. Select the range of fixtures to be fanned.
    
2. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode.
    
3. Select a Function from the sliding picker.
    
4. Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning.
    
5. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode.
    

> Selecting a different parameter will also turn Fan mode off.

**Common Fan Functions are :**

-   {Fade In} / = lowest to highest
    
-   {Fade Out} \ = highest to lowest
    
-   {Diagonal} -/- = Standard PAN Fan
    
-   {Saw Tooth} /\ = Mirror lowest on ends to highest in middle
    
-   {Mirror} / = Highest on ends to lowest in middle

    

> Function types may be freely changes while in Fan Mode to "audition" various results.

>  Any Function created in the Function Editor of the Advanced Effect Editor may be applied to Fan

**Block of and Sub Blocks:**

1. Select the range of fixtures to be fanned.
    
2. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode.
    
3. Select a Function from the sliding picker.
    
4. Select **Blocks of {#}**
    
5. Select **Sub Blocks {#}**
    
6. Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning.
    
7. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode.
    
**Examples of Blocks and Sub Blocks:**

-   {Fade In} - Blocks of 1 and no Sub Block

Instead of fanning Blocks based on the selection, fixture **Groups** may also be used as Blocks.

**To Fan Blocks By Groups:**

-   Using the Group SKs or using the keypad, select the Groups to be fanned
    
-   Tap {Blocks By Group}
    
-   Use any of the above methods to fan parameters by Group Parameters may also be fanned using keypad syntax.

### Highlight Mode {#highlight-mode-8.2.5.}

Highlight and Lowlight modes are used to help identify the positions of fixtures so that they may be edited more easily.

**Highlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way:**

-   Dimmer - Full
    
-   Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked
    
-   Position - unchanged and editable
    
-   Color - home values and masked
    
-   Beam - home values and masked
    
-   Image - home values and masked
    
-   Shape - home values and masked
    

**To Highlight fixtures or Groups:**

1. Select fixtures using keypad or using Groups.
    
2. Press [H.LIGHT] - The key will flash in <span style="color:Red">red</span> to indicate the mode is active. 

	**All** fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above.
    
3. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will remain "highlighted" and all other fixtures will return to their editor or stage values.
    
4.  Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture.
    
5. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused.
    
6. Press [H.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values.
    

> Highlight/Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection

**To swap new fixtures into Highlight:**

-   Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped.
    

> Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection.

Highlight may be customized when the default home values are too generic. Users may want to tighten the zoom or use a specific iris as a fixtures default.

**To create a custom Highlight Scene:**

1.   Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene
    
2.  Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [STORE]
    

> The Highlight Scene only affects the active fixture.

**To Delete the Highlight Scene:**

-   Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [DELETE]

### Lowlight Mode {#lowlight-mode-8.2.6.}

Lowlight mode is used when many fixtures are lit up and therefore Highlight is not helpful. **Lowlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way:**

-   Dimmer - 30% all fixtures **except** active fixture which will be at 100%
    
-   Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked.
    
-   Position - unchanged and editable
    
-   Color - home values and masked
    
-   Beam - home values and masked
    
-   Image - home values and masked
    
-   Shape - home values and masked Unlike Highlight, Lowlight maintains a value of 30% for dimmers while active.
    

**To "Lowlight" fixtures or Groups:**

1.   Select fixtures using the keypad or using Groups.
    
2.  <span style="color:Red">Press [L.LIGHT] - All dimmer parameters will go to 30%. [L.LIGHT] will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All other fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above.</span>
    
3. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will go to a dimmer value of 100% and all other fixtures dimmer values will remain at 30%. Other parameters will return to their editor or stage values.
    
4. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture.
    
5. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused.
    
6.  Press [L.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values.

>Highlight/Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made.
>Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection.

**To swap new fixtures into Lowlight:**

- Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight

	Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped.
>Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection.

Lowlight may be customized when the default home values are are too generic. Frequently users set the Lowlight dimmer to Zero instead of the default 30% to create a solo effect.

**To create a custom Lowlight Scene:**

1. Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene.
2. Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [STORE]

**To Delete the Highlight Scene:**

- Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [DELETE]

### Remainder Dim {#remainder-dim-rem-dim-8.2.7.}

**REM DIM** is an Editor Tool commonly used in theatr environments but can be useful in many other situations.

-   **{REM DIM}** Toggles all dimmer values to 0 except those that are selected. If no value is given in the editor, the selected fixtures will maintain their current values and not create a hard move.
    
-   While in {REM DIM}, [Next]/[Prev] will swap the Rem Dim fixture forwards or backwards.
    
-   If a selection of multiple fixtures is made followed by {REM DIM} all unselected fixtures will go to 0. The selected fixtures will not be changed or entered into the editor.
    
-   If a selection of multiple fixtures is made, [Next]/[Prev] will force all but the first fixture in the selection to 0. The next press of [Next]/[Prev] will force the first fixture to 0 and release the next fixture. Fixtures in the selection will continue to swap from 0 to release with each press of [Next]/[Prev].
    
-   Pressing REM DIM again toggles the feature off and restores the stage look.
    
-   Cues may be stored with {REM DIM} on but once stored, {REM DIM} is turned off.


### Home Scene {#home-scene-8.2.8}

By default released fixtures return to their home values as defined by the device's fixture profile. The device profile is usually based on the manufacturer's suggested defaults, but sometimes the defaults are not appropriate. Vibe allows users to customize Home Values by building a Home Scene. When a fixture is programmed in a Home Scene it will take preference over its home values in the device profile.

**Create a Home Scene:**

1.  Program fixtures in the editor to values that will work best as home values.
    
2.  Press [SCENE] [HOME] [STORE] - When released fixtures will now use the Home Scene as a reference.
    

**Delete a Home Scene:**

1.  Press [SCENE] [HOME] [DELETE] - Home values will return to the device profile's home values.

### Fixture Selection basics {#Fixture-Selection-basics-8.3.11}

Fixtures are selected using the **[FIXTURE]** key on the keypad. They also may be stored and recalled using the **[GROUP]** key. Fixtures may also be interactively selected via the Live Display or Live Parameter Display.

-   **[+] [-]** ⟶  keys are valid with Fixture selections and Groups.
    
-   **[FIXTURE]** ◾ (period) - Reselects the last selection.
    
-   **[FIXTURE]** ⟶  - Reselects all fixtures in the Editor.
    
-   **[CE]** - Backspaces the command line one character at a time but currently will not go back one command at a time.
    
-   **[VIBE]+[CE/CLEAR]** - Clears the command line to the beginning and ideal tee system.
    
-   **[RELEASE]**: 

◾ First press releases the active parameters (last adjusted) for selected fixtures. 

◾ Second press releases all remaining parameters for selected fixtures from the Editor.
    
-   **[DE SEL]** - Deselects all fixtures but maintains values in the Editor. This function is usually used to protect the operator from accidentally adjusting parameters in the Editor when they are temporarily captured. It may also be used to "idle" the command line to allow [TEXT] {SK} function while fixtures are still in the Editor.
    
-   **[RESET]** - Releases all parameters from the Editor.
    
-   **[VIBE]+[RESET]** - Releases all parameters from the Editor and releases all selected fixtures.
    
-   **[NEXT]/ [PREV]** - Increments or decrements fixtures in a selection. When used with a Group, will be confined to the fixtures in the Group.

-   **[VIBE]+[NEXT]/ [PREV]** - Increments or decrements fixtures in a selection, keeping the fixtures' amount and distance.
    
-   **Trackball [X LOCK] / [Y LOCK]** - Locks the X or Y axis of the trackball.
    
-   **[RES]** - Sets global encoder resolution. <span style="color:Blue">Blue</span> = Low 8 bit, <span style="color:MediumAquaMarine">Green</span> = Medium 10 bit (Default) <span style="color:Red">red</span> = High 16 bit.
    

> Holding the [VIBE] key down while turning an encoder temporarily sets the encoder to high resolution 16 bit.

> Vibe uses a precision algorithm for encoders. Based on the starting resolution, the slower an encoder is turned, the more resolution it has.

### What are Parameters {#What-are-Parameters-8.3.2.}


Parameters are any features of a device that may be manipulated and stored in an object. Examples of parameters would be:

-   Dimmer
    
-   Pan/Tilt
    
-   Cyan/Yellow/Magenta
    
-   Zoom
    
-   Gobo 1
    
-   Blade Rotate
    

In Vibe parameters are organized under six standard **Banks** and one special Bank:

1.  Intensity
    
2.  Position
    
3.  Color
    
4.  Beam
    
5.  Image
    
6.  Shape
    
7.  Control - A special bank as its parameters are not stored in cues. 
Instead it sends "real time" messages to fixtures control functions.

8.  Media
    
The switch between banks can be done either from the touch screen or through the combination SHIFT + # where the # represents the bank number.

Parameter values may be set using either Vibe's intuitive **Smart Screen** picker system or conventional parameter wheels and keypad method.



### Virtual Parameters {#Virtual-Parameters-8.3.3}

See:

-   [7.1. Virtual Parameters](#OperationalPhilosophy-7.1.)



### Smart Screen {#Smart-Screen-8.3.4}


The 11.6" multi-touch monitor directly above the 4 encoder wheels is referred to as the **Smart Screen.**

The **Smart Screen** is dedicated to displaying:

-   Context sensitive interactive bank, and parameter information.
    
-   Encoder wheel displays.
    
-   Playback information for the controllers that are directly above it.
    
-   Special pop-ups for Libraries, Store options and Grab functions.
    
-   A simplified Effects editor.
    
-   Displays for Fan feature.
    
The Bank buttons on the Smart Screen, used to access the different parameters of the selected fixtures, have the following behavior:
- Bank buttons 1-6 are always enabled. (i.e., to access libraries in the Context view)
- If the Bank is enabled and active (there are parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has White text.
- If the Bank is enabled and inactive (there are no parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has Black text.
- If the Bank is disabled (not functional in the current selection), it is grayed out and not accessible.
- If the Bank is currently selected, it has a colored background.


**The Smart Screen is divided into six sections:**


**Intensity**

Intensity bank has parameters like Dimmer, Shutter and Strobe.

The dimmer level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the predefined incremental steps.

The strobe and shutter level, mode and frequency can be set in the smart screen with the macros showing the selected fixtures' properties.
 <p align=center> Smart Screen - Intensity Bank</p>

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F0GXVq4t1bY5T7JQLMOu3%2F8.3.4%20intensity.webp?alt=media&token=504f1895-55b0-476a-8982-503e55203f65)


The Context sensitive area changes depending on the bank and fixture type. Where possible, similar parameters from different fixture types will be presented to the user using Vibe's universal fixture model. This means that is not necessary to memorize the manufacturer's specification of each fixture, as all fixtures are programmed in a similar consistent way.



**Position**

Position bank has parameters like Pan and Tilt.

The fixtures' position can be set either with the editor keys, wheels, and trackball, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the position picker.

The position is calculated at the same time on Pan/Tilt values and on virtual XYZ values, based on the fixture's calibration on the stage.

Independently from the fixture's pan and tilt range, the virtual XYZ coordinates allow easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different pan and tilt range, the XYZ values will automatically recover the positions.

**Color**

Color bank has parameters like Color Mix (RGB, CMY, RGBW, ...) and Color Wheels.

The color level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders in "Params" screen, the color picker in "Virtual" screen, or the color presets.

The color mix is calculated at the same time on the color values and on virtual HSI values, based on the fixture's color mixing system.

Independently from the fixture's color mixing system, the color picker based on HSI system allows easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different color mixing system, the virtual HSI values will automatically recover the fixture's colors.

The color wheels are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the image picker to get complete control on the wheels' features.

The color mix can also be set by using the predefined preset combinations and Vibe's smart features.

> Dimmer is implied, but parameter would normally be specified after  [+ ⟶ -] and before value.

> **[CE]** will backspace the command line one character at a time. 
> <span style="color:Gray">If more than one state is involved, the state will backspace right up until the idle state</span>.

> **[Shift CE]** will clear the command line to the beginning and put the system in an idle state.

- [Fixture] # [+ ⟶  -] [[Full]/[Zero] (@100 and @00 are valid if % or text display format).
        
- Fixture] # [+ ⟶  -] [@] enter value. Two digits are required to complete value entry.
        
- [Fixture] # [+ ⟶  -] [@] [@] will set values to Full.
        
- [Fixture] # [+ ⟶  -] [@] single value, [ENTER]. E.g. [Fixture] [1⟶ 6] [@] [5] [ENTER] will set a value of 50%. [@] [7] [ENTER] would set a value of 70%.
        
- Pressing [ENTER] at the end of value input is optional and does not affect the sequence. In most cases, it will simply terminate the command line.
        
- [Fixture] # will jump the **live display** screen to the specified fixture if the fixture is not visible on the screen. (Fixture Jumping must be enabled in the **Live Display, {Tools}** (Wrench icon)Pop-up under the **Behavior** Tab
        
- [Fixture] # [+ ⟶  -] [@] [+] [value] or [@] [-] [value] will make a **relative** change to the stage value. E.g. {If the stage value is 50, @ + 10 will set the value to 60. @ - 30 would set the value to 20}. 
The rules for single digit plus Enter will also apply.
        
- [Fixture] # [⟶ ] #, Parameter, [@] {value] [⟶ ] [value] will **fan** the range. (if no parameter is specified, dimmer/intensity will be fanned) 0, and 100% are also valid as well as [Zero] and [Full].
        
- [Fixture] # [⟶ ] # Parameter, [@] [value] [⟶ ][⟶ ] [value] will **mirror** fan the range. {1➡⟶ 100 would produce 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0}
        
- Fixture **Dot** = Restore last.  <span style="color:Gray">Will have a toolbar equivalent.</span>
        
- Fixture ⟶  = Reeelect Editor. <span style="color:Gray">Will have a toolbar equivalent. </span>
        
- Fixtures and Parameters may be deselected using [RELEASE/DE SEL] Key. This leaves values in the editor but not under the control of the wheels.
        
- [GROUP] # selects all fixtures that are recorded into the group. *The typed fixture order is preserved in a recorded group.
        
- With groups, parameters may be fanned via syntax as above, but their recorded order will be considered.
        
- Control without having to press Shift, Reset, which clears the values in the Editor.
        
- **{LIBRARY}, {LIBRARY}**, will select and enter values from a library into the Editor. This is especially useful when using position libraries as groups with positions.
