### Editing

**Editing Properties**

`r create_image_tag("04.Settings", "4.1-Editing")`

**Default Stage Value:**

-   Home Value: when released fixtures parameters return to their home values as specified in the device's definition or user **Home Scene**.
    
-   Maintain Last Value: when released fixture parameters remain at their current value, except for the dimmer.
    
**Auto Param Grouping:**

-   When enabled, parameters are grouped as follows:

|  **Bank** |              **Parameters**              | **Grouping** |
|:---------:|:----------------------------------------:|:------------:|
| Intensity |                                          |  Not Grouped |
|  Position |                 Pan, Tilt                |    Grouped   |
|  Position |               Virtual X/Y/Z              |    Grouped   |
|   Color   |               All Color Mix              |    Grouped   |
|   Color   |               CMY Color Mix              |    Grouped   |

**Clear Editor After Store:**

- After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until \[RESET] or \[VIBE] + \[RESET] is pressed.

**Automatically Assign Cues to PB:**

- After storing a cue, it is automatically assigned to the Master Controller.

**Editor Flash:**

Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature.
    
-   {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values)
    
-   Defaults are {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%)

**Qlist Behaviour:**

Tracking / Non-Tracking:

-   Tracking: 

    - Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values.
    
-   Non-Tracking: 

    - Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero.
    
> <span style="color:Red">In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the **Store Options** {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors.</span>

**Clear Editor on Master GO:**

-   The editor will be reset when **GO** on the **Master Controller** is pressed.
    
**Store Scene by Default:**

-   By default \[STORE] \[HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue.
    
-   Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax \[STORE] \[CUE] \[HERE] (press any controller button).
    
**Next Cue Increment:**

-   When \[Store] \[Here], \[STORE] \[STORE], or \[STORE] \[ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used.
    
> If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20.

**Apply Compulite Mode:** 

Sets a number of default settings to emulate the traditional non-tracking Compulite Mode.

-   Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value}
    
-   {Clear Editor After Store} = Off
    
-   {Automatically Assign Cues to PB} = Off
    
-   Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking}
    
**ON Value:**

-   Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the \[ON] key is pressed.
    
-   <span style="color:Gray">{First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing \[ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default.</span>
    
**Restore Defaults:**

-   {Restore Popup Positions} - Restores the position of the popups that have been moved.
    
-   {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set.
    
-   {Restore Factory} - Restores settings changes to factory defaults.
    
-   {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to **show specific defaults**.

-   Default Time used when a controller's parameters are reasserted with the \[ASSERT] \[HERE] command.
    
**Default GOTO Time:**

**Use Cue Time:**

-   The Back, Asset and GOTO times may be seet to use the Cue Time as default by enabling the \[Use Cue Time] button.

-   Set All Controllers Off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers.
    
> Once all is set ON individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time.

**Slider behavior:**

-   **Intensity Only** - Slider only controls the intensity.
    
-   **Go + Fade Parameters** - Moving the slider off zero will initiate a GO command. All parameters, except intensity, will fade to their recorded values using cue time. Intensity will remain under the control of the slider.
    
-   **Go + Jump Parameters** - Parameters Jump to their values as soon as the slider moves off zero. Intensity will remain under the control of the slider.

**Priority**

-   **Virtual Priority Wheel** - Sets the controller's LTP group number. Controllers assigned higher numbers cannot be overridden by lower numbers. Controllers assigned the same number will be LTP among themselves. Values may be entered using the virtual wheel or directly by tapping the middle of the center area of the wheel and typing a value from the keypad.
    
**Restore defaults**

-   Resets Controller settings to their last stored configuration.
