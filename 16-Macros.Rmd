## Creating Macros


Current Macros can only be created using the **Teach Macro** recorder. In future releases this will expand to include manually created macros. Macro time is automatically recorded with macros and the user may decide whether to enable time or ignore it.

**Record a Macro:**

1.  Press [TEACH] - Vibe will enter Teach Macro record mode and the [TEACH] key will flash red.
    
2.  Press editor keys or controller buttons as required.
    
3.  Press [TEACH] again to terminate the recording - the [TEACH] key will stop flashing and the key presses are now stored in the Macro clipboard.
    
4.  Press [STORE] [HERE] to a Macro Softkey. OR
    
5.  Press [MACRO] [#] [STORE] - The Macro is now stored.
    
6.  Press [TEXT] to open the Text Pop-up and label the Macro - this is only valid directly after storing the MAcro. Alternately [Macro] [#] [TEXT] may be used at any time to label the Macro.

1.  Use steps 1 ➡️ 3 to store the macro to the Macro clipboard.
    
2.  Press [MACRO] [#] [TIME][STORE] - The Macro is now stored including it's timing.

## Triggrering Macros



Macros may be directly triggered using the keypad or Macro Softkeys.

**Trigger a Macro using the keypad:**

-   [MACRO] [#] [ENTER]
    

**Trigger a Macro using Macro Softkeys:**

-   Tap the required {Macro} Softkey.
    

<span style="color:RoyalBlue">**Trigger a Macro from a Qkey: Currently Unimplemented**</span>
-   Assign the Macro to the Qkey by pressing [MACRO] [#] [HERE] to any Qkey button.
    
-   Press the Qkey button to activate.
    


## Attaching Macros


Macros may be attached and triggered from Qlist Cues.

**Attach a Macro to a Cue:**

-   [CUE] [#] [MACRO] [#] [STORE]
    

**Release a specific Macro from a Cue:**

-   [CUE] [#] [MACRO] [#] [RELEASE]
    

**Release all Macros from a Cue:**

-   [CUE] [#] [MACRO] [RLEAEASE]
    

**Macros are triggered when:**

-   The Qlist is advanced to the cue with the trigger.
    
-   [GOTO] commands are used.
    
-   [CUE] [#] [GO] is used.
    

>Back commands will not trigger Macros or Snap.


**Temporarily disable triggers:**

1.  Tap the controller display header for the Qlist that contains Macro or Snap triggers - The Qlist Properties pop-up will appear. OR
    
2.  [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button and select the Qlist Properties tab.
    
3.   Deselect the {Trigger} button - Triggering will be disabled for the incident of the Qlist assigned to that **specific** controller.
