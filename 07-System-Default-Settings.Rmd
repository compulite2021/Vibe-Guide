**Default Stage Value:**

-   Home Value - When released, fixtures parameters will return to their home values as specified in the device's definition or user **Home Scene**.
    
-   Maintain Last Value - When released, fixture parameters will remain at their current position but dimmer will go out.
    

**Auto Parameter Grouping:**

-   When on, parameters are grouped as follows:

**Clear Editor After Store:**

-   Default editor behaviour when in Compulite Mode - After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until [RESET] or [VIBE]+[RESET] is pressed.
    

**Editor Flash:**

-   Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature.
    
-   {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values)
    
-   Defaults - {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%)
    

**Apply Compulite Mode:** - Sets a number of defaults to emulate traditional nontracking Compulite Mode.

-   Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value}
    
-   {Clear Editor After Store} = Off
    
-   {Advance To Cue After Store} = Off
    
-   Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking}
    

---

**Editing Properties:** - Cueing Section

Tracking - Non-Tracking:

-   Tracking On: 

◾ Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values.
    
-   Non-Tracking: 

◾ Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero.
    

> In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the **Store Options** {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors.

**Clear Editor on Master GO:**

-   The editor will be reset when GO on the Master Controller is pressed.
    

**Store Scene by Default:**

-   By default [STORE] [HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue.
    
-   Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax [STORE] [CUE] [HERE] (press any controller button).
    

**Next Cue Increment:**

-   When [Store] [Here], [STORE] [STORE], or [STORE] [ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used.
    

> E.g. If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20.


**Editing Properties:** - ON Value

-   Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the [ON] key is pressed.
    
-   {First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing [ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default.
    

**Restore and Save Defaults:**

-   {Restore Popup Positions} - Currently redundant.
    
-   {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set.
    
-   {Restore Factory} - Restores console to "read only" defaults.
    
-   {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to **show specific** defaults without exiting the pop-up.

**Default Back Time:**

-   Timing is used when the [Back] or [Hold Back] Buttons are pressed.
    

**Default Assert:**

-   Timing is used when a controller's parameters are reasserted with the [ASSERT] [HERE] command.
    
-   Use Cue Time - As the Assert command is basically a GOTO command to the same cue that is active, the cue time for the cue being reasserted may be used instead of the Default Assert time.
    

**Default GOTO Time:**

-   Default timing when the GOTO command is used. GOTO time can be overridden using command [GOTO] [CUE] [#] [TIME] [Value]Press [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png)  or [ENTER]. 
    

**Default Release Time:**

-   Default Fade out time for parameters being released from the editor using the [RESET], parameter [RELEASE] keys, or Controllers being released from the stage (turned off) using the controller [RELEASE] button.

**Look Ahead** Section:

-   Set all controllers on will enable the Look Ahead function for all controllers.
    
-   Set all controllers off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers.
    

> Once all is set on, individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time. Once all off, individual controllers may be enabled Look Ahead at any time.



**Timing Properties - Snap** Section:

**Flash behaviour:**

-   **Release On Release** - While a Flash button is depressed, the controller will assert its values, when released the controller will be released from affecting the stage.
    
-   **Pure LTP** - Pressing a Flash key reasserts overridden LTP values from another controller but does not release them when the flash key is released.
    
-   **Go On Flash** - If a slider is down it will flash the intensity to full **and** advance the Qlist in cue time with every press of the Flash key.
    
-   **Latch** - Flash key toggles ON/OFF.
    

**Slider Behaviour:**

-   **Intensity Only** - Slider only controls the intensity.
    
-   **Go + Fade Parameters** - Moving the slider off zero will initiate a GO command. All parameters **except** intensity will fade to their recorded values using cue time. Intensity will remain under the control of the slider.
    
-   **Go + Jump Parameters** - Parameters Jump to their values as soon as the slider moves off zero. Intensity will remain under the control of the slider.
    
-   **Release At Bottom** - The controller will be released from affecting the stage when the slider reaches zero. Default System Release Time or Qlist Release Time will be used.

**Defaults** - Controller Settings: Priority

-   **Virtual Priority Wheel** - Sets the controller's LTP group number. Controllers assigned higher numbers cannot be overridden by lower numbers. Controllers assigned the same number will be LTP among themselves. Values may be entered using the virtual wheel or directly by taping the middle of the centre area of the wheel and typing a value from the keypad.
