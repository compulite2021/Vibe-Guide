## Important Terms


-   **DMX 512 Output/Input Port** - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter.
    
-   **DMX 512 Universe** - Virtual DMX outputs 0 ‚û°Ô∏è 256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols. ‚óæ Compulite VC protocol ‚óæ w Art-Net 3 w ‚óæ sACN
    
-   **SET** = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets), 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures), 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors), 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures), 4 = Servers (Video servers), 5 ‚û°Ô∏è 1000 = User defined sets
    
-   **Parameter** - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo.
    
-   **Controllers** - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots.
    
-   **Submaster** - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value.
    
-   **Master Controller** - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys.
    
-   **Slider** - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader.
    
-   **Qkey** - A single button Controller.
    
-   **Assert** - Takes back control of parameters that have been "robbed" by other controllers.
    
-   **HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence)** - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications.
    
-   **LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence)** - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output it's values to the stage no matter what the value.
    
-   **[SELECT]** - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller.
    
-   **Qlist** - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999.
    
-   **Cue** - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values.
    
-   **Scene** - A look that exists independent of a Qlist.
    
-   **Library** - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced.
    
-   **Options** - Used to modify object properties "on the fly"
    
-   **Settings** - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created.
    
-   **Cue Zero** - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid.
    

For the sake of this guide, **Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets** will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets

Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)

This chapter provides an overview of Vibe's Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**The following is covered in this chapter:**
-  4.1. Introduction
-  4.2. {VIBE} Menu
-  4.3. Layouts
-  4.4. Smart Screen
-  4.5. Toolbars
-  4.6. Live Display
-  4.7. Live Parameter Display


## Introduction

Vibe uses a Multi-touch based interface with simple familiar gestures for navigation.

-   Supported gestures: ‚óæ Two fingers for swipe and scrolling. ‚óæ One finger select. ‚óæ Multi-selection via ‚§¥Ô∏è‚§µÔ∏èshaped gestures. ‚óæ Multi-selection via window.
    
-   Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added using DisplayPort 1.2 or higher MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large 21" embedded screen is general-purpose like the external monitors.
    
-   The smaller 11.6" **Smart Screen** is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive parameter information such as color pickers and gobo pickers.
    
-   Each monitor, (excluding the **Smart Screen**) can contain one Window Frame.
    
-   Window frames can contain one of three **Workspace Templates**.
    
-   Each Template has a dedicated display in the lower area. This area will have different fixed options and information depending on the selected Workspace Template.
    
-   The remainder of the template may be freely customized by the user.
    
-   Each Template can contain up to 4 **Pages** that can be toggling using the **WorkSpace**  **Template**  **Keys** or by tapping the yellow **{VIBE}** Menu key at the bottom left of each Workspace Template and tapping the **{PAGES}** key to the right of the **{VIBE}** key to open the page's display.
    
-   Each Monitor (excluding the **Smart Screen**) can contain its own independent set of **WorkSpace**  **Templates**.
    
-   Workspace Templates are organized into three familiar categories, each with a dedicated display key. These keys are found above the top left corner of the **Smart Screen**: ‚óæ **[PATCH]** ‚óæ **[PROG]** - (Program) ‚óæ **[PLAY-B]** - (Playback Controllers)
    
-   The Workspace Template Keys are specific to the monitor that has focus (last touched or selected via a mouse).
    
-   **The Patch Template** by default has a fixed command line and patch tool bar at the bottom, and a pre-built patch display on page 1. Except for the bottom toolbar, the patch display may be freely customized via the **{VIBE}** Menu.
    
-   **The Program Template** contains a command line and fixed display of the 15 motorized Slider controllers. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the **{VIBE}** Menu. The controller display may be toggled to display the Qkey controller display using the **[SWAP DISPLAY]** key at the top left corner of the controller panel.
    
-   **The Playback Template** contains a command line and a fixed display of both the 15 motorized fader controllers and the 15 Qkey controllers at the same time. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the **{VIBE}** Menu. The controller displays may be swapped to display the Qkey controllers on the bottom row via the **[SWAP DISPLAY]** key at the top left corner of the controller panel.

## {VIBE} Menu

The **{VIBE}** Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped sub-menus. It is used to access common system functions such as **Save** and **System Settings** as well as configure **Workspace Template** displays.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kixy9336g2t5pcj/4.2.png?dl=1)

**Configuring WorkSpaces:**

-   When configuring workspaces, any object at the end of the hierarchical sub-menu can be tapped to open its object on a blank portion of the current workspace or dragged and dropped to the workspace surface. Once on the surface it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting.
    
-   If an object is dragged on top of another both will turn green and become one **tabbed** object.
    
-   To edit the placement of objects, the **{Lock}** icon beside the **{VIBE}** menu key  must be toggled to unlock the workspace display. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the display and allow normal usage.
![**Library Softkeys randomly sized and placed on the [PROGRAM] Workspace**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpd3wlwhvd8rc3q/4.2.1.png?dl=1)


## Layouts

**Layouts:**

-   After all workspaces and associated pages are configured, the display configurations of the workspaces can be saved to a **Layout** by tapping the **{VIBE}** Menu and then the **{LAYOUT}** key. A Sub-menu will open with options to **{SAVE LAYOUT}**, **{LOAD LAYOUT}**.
    
-   After configuring external monitors, a layout should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot.
    
-   Layouts remember the configuration of external monitors and a warning message will appear if the system is booted without the expected external monitor.

## Smart Screen


The 11.6" multi-touch monitor embedded in the upper section of the Vibe console is referred to as the **Smart Screen**. The **Smart Screen** is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive bank, wheel, and parameter information. **For more detail see:**

9.3.4 Smart Screen

## Toolbars


**The Editor Toolbar contains is a set of interactive Softkeys that are used to access less common commands:**

-   **Position** - In the form of a cursor that moves in a black rectangle representing the stage.
    
-   **Color** - In the form of a circular color swatch - Color wheels are not currently supported.
