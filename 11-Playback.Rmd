# Playback

This chapter deals with the assignment of Qlists and Scenes to the Controllers and the management of playback settings.

**The following is covered in this chapter:**

-  [11.1 Physical Controllers](#Physical-Controllers-11.1)
-  [11.2 Virtual Controllers](#Virtual-Controllers-11.2)
-  [11.3 Controller Keys](#Controller-Keys-11.3)
-  [11.4 Controller Configuration](#Controller-Configuration-11.4)
-  [11.5 Live Controller](#Live-Controller-11.5)
-  [11.6 Teach Rate](#Teach-Rate-11.6)


## Physical Controllers {#Physical-Controllers-11.1}


Playback is done with Controllers, that can be both physical or virtual.

Controllers are divided into different types, characterized by the quantity of buttons, faders and knobs available.

Vibe has five controller types, with the following quantities and numbering:

1.  **A/B Crossfader**: Non-Motorized pair of Sliders with dipless crossfade and Two buttons
-   1 Non-motorized A/B dipless crossfader - Numbered 401
    
2.  **Slider**: Motorized Slider Controllers with Three buttons 
-   30 pages of 100 Motorized Sliders - Numbered 1.1 âŸ¶  30.100
    
3.  **Qkey**: Pressable knob or Single button Controllers 
-   30 pages of 100 Qkeys - Numbered 1.101 âŸ¶  30.200
    
4.  **AuxKey**: Single button Controllers
-   30 pages of 100 Auxkeys - Numbered 1.201 âŸ¶  30.300
    
5.  **Global Slider**: Non-Motorized Slider Controllers
-   100 Non-motorized Global Sliders - Numbered 301 âŸ¶  400

ðŸ‘‰ Controllers are numbered from right to left to facilitate continuous numbering with physical and virtual controller wings.

Controllers are used to playback or execute a number of stored objects:

-   Qlists and Cues

-   Chasers

-   Scenes

-   Submasters

-   Groupmasters

-   Libraries

-   Macros

The following samples explain how to assign a Qlist to any controller, but the syntax to assign any other stored object is the same.

Assign a Qlist to a Controller:

1.  \[QLIST] \[#] OR Object Softkey
    
2.  \[HERE] to any button of the target controller.
    
ðŸ‘‰ Blank Qlists may also be assigned to any controller.

ðŸ‘‰ If a non existing Qlist is assigned, it will be created.

Assign a range of Qlists to consecutive Controllers:

1.  \[QLIST] \[#] â†’ \[QLIST] \[#]
    
2.  \[HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the first of the range.
    
Assign a Single Cue to a controller:

1.  \[QLIST] \[#] \[CUE] \[#]
    
2.  \[HERE] to any button of the target controller.
    
**Controller Color Codes**

The objects assigned to any controller are identified by the Controller Color Codes, that are referred to the physical buttons' LEDs and to the virtual controllers' background.

Controller color coding from \[SELECT] Master Controller:

-   <font color="cyan">**Cyan**</font> = Initial Hard Value
-   <font color="blue">**Blue**</font> = Hard Value Changing Upward
-   <font color="green">**Green**</font> = Hard Value Changing Downward
-   <font color="purple">**Purple**</font> = Tracked Value
-   <font color="red">**Red**</font> = Redundant Block (may be released with {**Unblock**})
-   <font color="magenta">**Magenta**</font> = Skip Value

Controller color coding from non-\[SELECT] Master Controller:

-   <font color="amber">**Yellow**</font> = Output from a Qlist, Cue, Scene
-   **Submaster** or **Group Master** = [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FjlksQ7Tw3y1W3D7BaGEF%2F00-Submaster-Icon.webp?alt=media&token=6904cabb-0530-43c7-8a7e-d6d1f1627c3f">](00-Submaster-Icon.webp)

Controller Display and Backlit Controller Key's color coding:

-   Top Button:
    - <font color="gray">**Dim White**</font> = Unloaded
    - <font color="black">**White**</font> = Loaded
    - <font color="green">**Green**</font> = Qlist, Cue Active
    - <font color="red">**Red**</font> = Chaser Active
    - <font color="amber">**Yellow**</font> = Scene Active
    - <font color="blue">**Blue**</font> = Sub or Group Master @ FL
    - <font color="black">**Any of above Flashing**</font> = In Progress

-   Middle Button:
    - <font color="gray">**Dim White**</font> = Unloaded
    - <font color="black">**White**</font> = Loaded
    - <font color="blue">**Blue**</font> = Select (Master Controller)
    - <font color="red">**Flashing Red**</font> = Back
    - <font color="amber">**Flashing Yellow**</font> = Pause

-   Bottom Button:
    - <font color="gray">**Dim White**</font> = Unloaded
    - <font color="black">**White**</font> = Loaded
    - <font color="blue">**Blue**</font> = Select (Master Controller)

### Grand Master + BlackOut

<p align=center> ![11.1-GM+BO](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FBuHYeHU8VWvHQ3YtHY4C%2F11.1-GM%2BBO.webp?alt=media&token=307468f4-d0d0-4530-a532-23533cb54a6a){height=500px} </p>

The main controllers of the console are the Grand Master, or GM, and the BlackOut, or B.O.

- The Grand Master proportionally limits the output values of all the DMX addresses that have a Dimmer parameter patched.

- The BlackOut toggles at Full or Zero the output values of all the DMX addresses that have a Dimmer parameter patched.

- The Grand Master slider and the BlackOut button are the only "special" controllers that cannot be customized; their functions cannot be changed and they cannot have any object assignment.

- The Grand Master slider and the BlackOut button have priority over the whole system, including all the Playback controllers and also the Editor.

### A/B CrossFader

<p align=center> ![11.1-AB-Xfader](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FfvgXDkcqoTN9YdqRtEAD%2F11.1-AB-Xfader.webp?alt=media&token=f1f643c6-4aca-43c3-bcea-82f63b5196ce){height=500px} </p>

## Virtual Controllers {#Virtual-Controllers-11.2}


All the controllers can be added on the layout as Virtual Controllers.

Any controller can be both physical and virtual, and the list of all the Virtual Controller Views available can be found in the Playback Views submenus.

Virtual Controllers may be added as a single part (fader or button), as complete set, or in sets of 5 consecutive controllers.

The Virtual Controllers may be added to the Vibe Layout, moved, assigned and resized as preferred. 

Vibe software makes no distinction between physical and virtual controllers, this allows the system hardware to be virtually scaled.

### Grand Master + BlackOut

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-GM+BO](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FhrHZoPnVEZtQfvc9LQSl%2F11.2-Virtual-GM%2BBO.webp?alt=media&token=a80beef9-6cf6-4022-8225-86176bd56d6f){height=500px} </p>

Open the virtual Grand Master with \[SHIFT] + \[B.O.]

In this view the Grand Master level can be set, it can be Disabled, and it also can be set to operate on a user-defined range, from 0%-100% to 0%-200%.

The Proportional Grand Master Level can be used for example in touring productions, where the rehearsal and the lighting programming may be done in a medium-sized venue for a show that will be performed both in smaller and bigger stages. Setting the G.M. at 100% with a level range up to 200% will allow the operator to keep enough margin to light up the bigger venues without need to add more fixtures.

The Disable GM button completely inhibits the Grand Master, while it is possibly to exclude form the Grand Master just specific DMX addresses. This is done via the Address View by editing the Address Properties.

A Virtual BlackOut button can be added to the layout by selecting it from the Single Button popup into the Program Views menu.

### A/B Crossfader

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-AB](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2F636jtLTCbEm0vUPK6EH0%2F11.2-Virtual-AB.webp?alt=media&token=0bb3e16d-8923-4a54-b062-9f22c9226003){height=500px} </p>

The Virtual A/B Crossfader has a Locker between the sliders used to set if the sliders' behaviour should be Splitted (**Separated**) or Merged (**In/Out**).

### Slider

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-Slider-Set](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FgZGMCl5CNUsg57iVS5Oh%2F11.2-Virtual-Slider-Set.webp?alt=media&token=0a380142-bea2-49aa-8d79-6dc8232929ae) </p>

Virtual Sliders show the controller's page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders.

### Qkeys

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-Qkey-Set](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FgTyMg8t5WFdSpioxR6Xc%2F11.2-Virtual-Qkey-Set.webp?alt=media&token=85b27b29-5f67-48ca-8018-46d1af9cc2ee) </p>

Qkeys can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller's hardware (single button or knob).

Virtual QKeys show the controller's page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders.

### Auxkey

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-Auxkey-Set](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2Fn540yqAjEOEjgW3XNOML%2F11.2-Virtual-Auxkey-Set.webp?alt=media&token=b19361a4-86d8-45c3-9cbb-697438198285) </p>

Auxkeys can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller's hardware (single button).

Virtual AuxKeys show the controller's page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders.

### Global Slider

<p align=center> ![11.2-Virtual-Global-Slider-Set](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FSiriADzNvmCs21idtqEF%2F11.2-Virtual-Global-Set.webp?alt=media&token=872afad5-3f6d-4100-864e-7fc3b2c42b8e) </p>

Global Sliders can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller's hardware (the physical global sliders are only on the main Vibe console, but the virtual global sliders can be added to any layout).

Virtual Global Sliders show the controller's page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders.


## Controller Keys {#Controller-Keys-11.3}


### Master Keys

- The Master Controller is the main controller to which the Master Keys and the syntax shortcuts are referred to.

- One of the controllers is always assigned as the Master Controller. 

- Not more than one controller can be assigned as the Master Controller at the same time.

- Any Controller may become the Master Controller at any time.

- To assign a controller as the Master, press **\[SELECT]** \[HERE] to any of the buttons of the controller. 

- The LED color of the second button and the background of the virtual controller that identify the Master Controller is <span style="color:Blue">dark blue</span>.

<span style="color:Red">The A/B is only linked to the Master Controller if the \[SELECT] is assigned to A/B.</span>

- The Master Controller is linked to the Master Controller Keys.

<p align=center> ![11.3-Virtual-Master-Keys](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2Fs5ICrEzOojPfJUo7QSGE%2F11.3-Virtual-Master-Keys.webp?alt=media&token=a0c265f2-7d88-4ab6-8027-925d9f38f06c) </p>

The Master Controller has 4 buttons associated:

-   \[GO] - Initiates a forward timed fade between cues in the selected Qlist using the **Cue Time**.
    
-   \[BACK] - Initiates a backward timed fade to the previous cue using the **Default Back Time**.
    
-   \[HOLD] - Pauses the progress of a fade. 

   - Pressing \[HOLD] again resumes the transition. 

   - Pressing \[GO] will resume the transition as well. 

   - Pressing \[BACK] will fade to the previous cue.

-   \[GOTO] - Advances to the specified cue using the **GOTO Time**. 

**Master shortcuts**

There are some syntax shortcuts used to speed up the programming that are always referred to the Master Controller. The most common ones are:

  - \[STORE] \[STORE] - stores a Cue to the first free position of the Qlist loaded on the Master.
  
  - \[STORE] \[ENTER] - stores a Cue to the first free position of the Qlist loaded on the Master.
  
  - \[CUE] \[#] \[STORE] - stores a Cue # to the Qlist loaded on the Master.
  
  - \[CUE] \[#] \[UPDATE] - updates the Cue # of the Qlist loaded on the Master.
  
  - \[CUE] \[#] \[EDIT] or \[TEXT] or \[TIME] or any other command - applies the command to the Cue # of the Qlist loaded on the Master.
  
  - \[UPDATE] - opens the update popup, where the Master Controller can be assigned as Source Filter.
  
  - \[GRAB] - opens the Grab popup, where the Master Controller can be set as Filter.

**GOTO Commands**

GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system GOTO Time:

-   \[CUE] \[#] \[GOTO]

GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using a specified Time:

-   \[CUE] \[#] \[TIME] - Enter time value \[GOTO]

GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system Cue Time:

-   \[CUE] \[#] \[TIME] \[GOTO]

GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using Goto Cue popup:

<p align=center> ![11.3-GOTO-Cue](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2F1ACRqc57zNfSpppYxzxI%2F11.3-GOTO-Cue.webp?alt=media&token=8cfa60fe-d10d-4b79-b374-e0377ed7a236) </p>

1.  Press \[GOTO] - Goto Cue popup will open.
    
2.  Select {Qlist} if not the current Qlist on the Master Controller.
    
3.  Select the {Cue}.
    
4.  Select behavior.
    
-   {Default GOTO time} - Uses system default GOTO Time.
    
-   {Cue Time} - Uses Cue's recorded time.
    
-   {Custom} - Set GOTO time using the Custom Time wheel or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and set the time value from the keypad.
    
-   {Release Master PB on Top} - Releases the Master Controller.

5.  Tap Apply or press \[ENTER] to close the popup and execute the GOTO.

<span style="color:Red">If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one on the Master Controller.</span>

GOTO a cue NOT on the Master Controller:

-   \[QLIST] \[#] \[CUE] \[#] \[GO] (Controller must have a GO button assigned).

GOTO Cue Zero (Cue Zero is essentially {Release PB}):

-   \[CUE] \[0] \[GOTO] 

GO out of sequence directly to a Cue on the Master Controller (in cue time):
    
-   \[CUE] \[#] \[GO]

### Operation Keys

Operational Keys allow to manage the controllers with basic and fundamental operations.

The Operation Keys are physical buttons on the panel and can be added as virtual a view on the layout.

<p align=center> ![11.3-Virtual-Operation-Keys](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FUf4hLdJhxJ1JfiBGl1TO%2F11.3-Virtual-Operation-Keys.webp?alt=media&token=a6fb2775-569b-4405-bd0f-e1a049f1e7a7) </p>

The Operational Keys are: Select, Load, Release, Free, Protect

  - \[**Select**] - Sets the target controller as the Master. 
    
  - \[**Load**] - Preloads a controller with a specified cue #, but does not advance to that cue. 
    
  - \[**Release**] - Releases the destination controller from affecting the stage (Turns it off).
    
  - \[**Free**] - Unloads the content from the controller (Makes it empty).
  
  - \[**Protect**] - Locks the system with a user defined one-time password. 

<span style="color:Red">\[Select] \[Load] \[Release] and \[Free] do not work with the big Master Controller buttons, only with any button on the controller that is associated with it as the \[SELECT] controller.</span>

GOTO and LOAD are used to crossfade to cues out of sequence. 

By default: 

- GOTO immediately transitions to the specified cue in the system **GOTO Time**. 

- LOAD preloads controllers. The next \[GO] will transition to the preloaded cue in **Cue Time**.

**Select Operations** 

Set a target controller as the Master:

-   \[SELECT] \[HERE] to any controller button.

The Mid and Flash buttons' LEDs and the Virtual controller's background become Blue.

**Load Operations** 

Load a cue on the Master Controller:

1.  \[CUE] \[#] \[LOAD] \[HERE] - To Controller assigned as \[SELECT]
    
2.  Press \[GO] - On Controller assigned as \[SELECT]
    
LOAD a cue NOT on the Master Controller:

1.   \[QLIST] \[#] \[CUE] \[#] \[LOAD] \[HERE] - Qlist and Cue will be preloaded.
    
2.  Press \[GO] - Controller will execute loaded cue.
    
<span style="color:Red">If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Controller is specified, that Qlist will replace the current one with the specified cue pending.</span>

**Release Operations** 

Vibe has two types of release functions, Editor Release and Controller Release. The following deals with Controller Release.

Controller Release is done using the system Release Time, as set in system default settings.

Release a controller:

-   \[RELEASE] \[HERE] to any controller button.

Pressing Release turns the Release button <span style="color:Red">Red</span>.

Release more controllers:

-   \[RELEASE] \[RELEASE] \[HERE] \[HERE] \[HERE]... to any controller button.

Pressing Release two times turns the Release button <span style="color:Red">flashing Red</span>.

Release All controllers.

-   \[VIBE] + \[RELEASE]

**Free Operations** 

Free unloads a controller and makes it empty, but it does not delete the loaded object.

Free a controller:

-   \[FREE] \[HERE] to any controller button.

Pressing Free turns the Free button <span style="color:Red">Red</span>.

Free more controllers:

-   \[FREE] \[FREE] \[HERE] \[HERE] \[HERE]... to any controller button.

Pressing Free two times turns the Free button <span style="color:Red">flashing Red</span>.

Free All controllers.

-   \[VIBE] + \[FREE]

**Protect Operations** 

- Protect is used to prevent the console to be operated by unwanted people.

- Protect uses a user defined one-time password to Lock the system, keep the password in mind and use it carefully.

To Lock the system:

-   \[PROTECT] \[PASSWORD] (any sequence of numbers) \[ENTER]

To Unlock the system:

-   \[PROTECT] \[PASSWORD] \[ENTER]

OR

-   Tap on the screen, Tap \[UNLOCK], insert the \[PASSWORD], Tap \[UNLOCK]

### Command Keys

Command Keys allow to manage the playback of the objects on the controllers, providing "On the Fly" access to button functions not directly assigned to controllers.

The Command Keys are physical buttons on the panel and can be added as a virtual view on the layout.

<p align=center> ![11.3-Virtual-Command-Keys](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FxJSrnq9WQ27TYaRTaZvq%2F11.3-Virtual-Command-Keys.webp?alt=media&token=27aa0fb7-10fa-4a19-8db2-c1d640b3af62) </p>

The Command Keys are: 

\[**Assert**] - Takes back control of parameters that have been "robbed" by other controllers. Assert acts as a Go command, but recalling the current Cue instead of the next one. 

\[**Flash**] - While pressed turns a controller On and at 100%. 

\[**Latch**] - <span style="color:Gray">Not implemented yet.</span>. 

\[**Solo**] - Turns off the intensity parameters on all controllers excluding the target controller.

\[**||<**] - Hold/Back command on a controller. If a controller is running, pauses the controller. If a controller is static, initiates a BACK command to the previous Cue using the Back Time or the Cue Time (as set in system timing settings). 

\[**<->**] - Reverses the sequence direction (mainly used with loops and chasers). 

\[**<<<**] - Steps backwards through a Qlist ignoring time ðŸ‘‰ \[VIBE] + \[BACK] will also step backwards through the list. 

\[**>>>**] - Steps forwards through a Qlist ignoring time ðŸ‘‰ \[VIBE] + \[GO] will also step forwards through the list. 

\[**Go**] - Go command on a controller. Initiates a GO command to the next cue using the Cue Time. 

\[**Go/Release**] - First press initiates a GO command, second press initiates a RELEASE command. 

\[**On**] - Instantly turns ON a controller. 

\[**Off**] - Instantly turns OFF a controller. 

ðŸ‘‰ All Command Keys work with the same syntax, that is also common to the Free and Release Operation Keys.

Command a controller:

-   \[COMMAND] \[HERE] to any controller button.

Pressing the Command turns the Command button <span style="color:Red">Red</span>.

Command more controllers:

-   \[COMMAND] \[COMMAND] \[HERE] \[HERE] \[HERE]... to any controller button.

Pressing the Command two times turns the Command button <span style="color:Red">flashing Red</span>.

Command All controllers.

-   \[VIBE] + \[COMMAND]

### Mode Keys

The Controller Mode keys are located at near the motorized sliders. 

The motorized sliders may be assigned to any one of 4 modes. 

Controller modes are are designed for "On the Fly" usage, allowing a quick modification to various rate and effect parameters. 

<p align=center> ![11.3-Slider-Mode-Keys](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FJLnSVdcibTaugj0fzi2L%2F11.3-Slider-Mode-Keys.webp?alt=media&token=f34d4fed-738a-44b9-8816-a8b46f138f87){height=500px} </p>

-   \[**FADERS**] - Normal behavior for the Sliders, as assigned in Controller Definitions
    
-   \[**RATE**] - The Sliders control the Rate of the fades, loops, effects, and chasers on the controller. Motorized faders will move to an optimized position of 33% allowing for proportional adjustment of a controller's rate.
    
-   \[**SIZE**] - The Sliders proportionally adjust the size of effects running on the controller.
    
-   \[**CHANNEL**] - The Sliders control single DMX Addresses. <span style="color:Gray">Not implemented yet.</span> 


## Controller Configuration {#Controller-Configuration-11.4}


Controller buttons and sliders may be customized to allow maximum flexibility. 

When Objects are initially assigned to Controllers, the buttons are configured as per the System Settings Defaults for Controller Actions and Controller Settings.

Each Controller may be configured individually by pressing \[SETTINGS] \[HERE] to any button of the controller or by tapping the box of the Playback Status view.

### Playback Status

Playback Status is a view that shows the current live information of the controller's content and configuration.

The PB Status may be added to the layout as a single box, for a single controller, or as a set of five consecutive controllers, usually positioned in the lower part of the screen.

The view's settings allow to set which target controller is shown, that may be the A/B Crossfader, a Slider, a Qkey, an AuxKey or a Global Slider.

<p align=center> ![11.4-PB-Status](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FZyTU5BFijaq62pwstEAf%2F11.4-PB-Status.webp?alt=media&token=676ba904-025a-4fbe-805b-ccea6b885b6e) </p>

The contents shown on the PB Status are:

- Controller Page and Number

- Loaded object Number and Name

- Loaded Object Type (based on the background color coding)

- Fader Level (with Purple background)

- Crossfade Rate Level (with Green background)

- Previous, Current, Next Cue (for Qlists and Chasers)

- Fader and Buttons Function Icons

Playback Status are also used for a direct access to the controller's actions and settings and for the content's properties configuration.

### Controller Defaults

Controllers' Defaults are divided in Actions and Settings.

To edit the defaults, open System Settings and tap on the Defaults Tab, then:

- Tap Controller Actions to open the Default Controller Actions popup

- Tap Controller Settings to open the Default Controller Settings popup

### Controller Settings

<p align=center> ![11.4-PB-Settings](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FOpGr00NLY5vZlUNalTjp%2F11.4-PB-Settings.webp?alt=media&token=62d1f596-adf3-4e88-8e41-d358982e72c9) </p>

The left column allows to select one or more controllers to be configured.

If **NO** controllers are selected, the popup turns to the Default Controller Settings.

**Flash behavior**

Options to set the behavior of the flash button:

- Release On Release

- Pure LTP

- Go On Flash

- Latch

**Slider behavior**

Options to set the behavior of the slider:

**Properties**

Options to set the properties of the controller:

- Exclude from Snap

- Exclude from Override

- Exclude from Free All

- Exclude from Release All

- Prevent from Paging

- Prevent from Grab

**Priority:**

-   Vibe keeps an LTP priority list of which controllers own parameters and the order in which they were asserted. Every time a controller is turned on, its parameters are asserted and the controller moves to the top of the list. Parameters that are still on active controllers but are currently overridden are said to be "robbed". When the controller that owns the parameter is released from the stage, the last active controller to own the robbed parameter is now moved back to the top of the list and reasserted the parameter to the stage.
    
-   This feature is very useful for "On the Fly" programming where a main Qlist may be temporarily overridden by Qkeys or Controllers and quickly restored when they are released.

<span style="color:Red">The Editor is always the highest propriety and will override any values from controllers until they are released or The Editor is reset</span>.

-   Controllers assigned the same Priority number will be LTP among themselves.
    
-   Controllers with lower Priority will be overridden by controllers with higher Priority.

-   Controllers with higher Priority cannot be overridden by controllers with lower Priority.

Assign Priority:

1. Tap the top area of a controller display, the Settings popup will open.

2. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab.

OR

1. Press \[SETTINGS] \[HERE] to any controller button, the Settings popup will open.

2. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab.

3. Rotate the virtual wheel to the desired Priority Group number or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and type a Priority number from 0 to 999.

<p align=center> ![11.4-PB-Settings-Priority](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FnEVRNlHw2RiRcbOPqFK1%2F11.4-PB-Settings-Priority.webp?alt=media&token=ebe22bcc-349d-4028-9e2b-43d28ea35dcc) </p>

**Move Controllers**

A controller can be moved to any other, even if it's a different type of controller.

The controller will be moved with all its settings and state, including intensity value etc.

ðŸ‘‰ If changes are made to individual controller Qlist Settings, those changes stay with the controller and are not copied or updated to other controllers with the same Qlist.
    
ðŸ‘‰ If it is desirable to update what will be copied to future assignments of the Qlist, toggle {**Save to Qlist**} On. Changes made to the current Qlist Settings will then be passed along the further Qlist assignments on other Controllers, in place of the Default Qlist Settings.
    
ðŸ‘‰ Qlist properties may be restored to their user defaults by tapping the {**Restore Default**} key.

**Chase Settings** 

<p align=center> ![11.4-Chase-Settings](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2Fd25Of6NE3lCrYXQbqgrj%2F11.4-Chase-Settings.webp?alt=media&token=23efcebc-2f1e-4a73-af8f-9355030b88ba) </p>

Chase Settings Tab is enabled only when the selected Qlist is in Chaser Mode.

**Cue Settings** 

<p align=center> ![11.4-Cue-Settings](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FfZkDxGODjwr1ue6g4kGT%2F11.4-Cue-Settings.webp?alt=media&token=05fa7ddd-d677-4a55-a6f2-0a8120fa5eed) </p>

Cue Settings popup opens by tapping on the Cue name into the Playback Status box.

The first column allows to select the Qlist containing the Cue to be configured.

The second column allows to select one or more Cues to be configured.

If **NO** Cues are selected, the popup turns to the Default Cue Settings.

The buttons under the column are used to:

  - **Re-number** the selected Cues.

  - **Link** the selected Cue to another.

  - **Loop** the selected Cue to another, defining the number of loops to be executed.

The third column contains the Cue Time Settings.

The behavior lists all the timing possibilities and the Time wheel allows to adjust the selected ones.

- **Block Cue**

- **Default (Track)**

Specific buttons are used to:

- **Force Black** - Enable/Disable a Force Black Cue before the selected Cue.

- **Color Fade** and **Position Fade** - Toggle between Physical and Virtual to define is the fade to the selected Cue will involve the physical or the virtual parameters, respectively regarding the Color and the Position.

The White fields under the columns may be used to write the Cue's name and the Cue's notes.

ðŸ‘‰ If the Cue selection is changed after editing the Cue settings, remember to press the APPLY button to store the changes, otherwise a popup will ask if you prefer to discard them.

ðŸ‘‰ Differently from the Qlist and Chase Settings, that can be stored only on the controller, the Cue Settings are directly stored to the Cue and kept in case of further assignments.

**Scene Settings** 

<p align=center> ![11.4-Scene-Settings](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FTPL5ihHWlCUuojf8zSSn%2F11.4-Scene-Settings.webp?alt=media&token=4720598b-1a9d-440b-bf1b-5e9e39342dc7) </p>

The first column allows to select one or more Scenes to be configured.

The second column contains the Scene Time Settings.

- **Time In** may be adjusted with the wheel.

The White field under the wheel may be used to write the Scene's name.

ðŸ‘‰ Differently from the Qlist and Chase Settings, that can be stored only on the controller, the Scene Settings are directly stored to the Scene, like the Cue Settings, and kept in case of further assignments.

### Compound Controllers

Controllers may be extended in width and height to make larger compound controllers. 

Compound controllers are used to expand the playback possibilities by getting more faders and buttons operating on the same object, so there can be more actions assigned. 

There is no limit as to how wide a controller may be, but for practical purposes, a limit of 6 controllers per content is suggested.

For example a single Qlist can be assigned to two Sliders and two Qkeys and set the control of the controllers in the following way:

- 1st Slider: Intensity, Go, Back, Flash

- 2nd Slider: Crossfade, Step Forward, Step Back, Blackout

- 1st Qkey: FX Rate, On

- 2nd Qkey: FX Size, Off

Other useful examples of compound controllers combinations are:

- creating additional Crossfader pairs, 

- adding Rate control to Chasers,

- setting Group Selection, Deselection and Release to Submasters,

- and many more...
    
<p align=center> ![11.4-Compound-Controllers](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2Fhf1ngGXebgmlAE8Zypyv%2F11.4-Compound-Controllers.webp?alt=media&token=ba588161-cc81-44db-bd7d-247bd0ac98fe) </p>

If Playback slider controllers and Qkey buttons are linked to the same object, it could be comfortable to synchronize the paging of Sliders and Qkeys. 

This is done by pressing \[VIBE] button together with the Up/Down paging buttons of either Playbacks or Qkeys.

### Playback Master

A Playback Master is a controller that masters other controllers.

The LED and background color for playback master is blue.

Any key command on the master will be triggered to the controlled Playbacks (GO, BACK, etc.).

Any fader behavior and movement on the master will be triggered to the controlled Playbacks (Intensity, Rate, etc.).

Playback Masters are stored in snaps.

**Set Up a PB Master**

1. Press \[PLAYBACK]

2. Tap \[MASTER] on the toolbar

3. Press any of keys of the playbacks to be mastered

4. Press \[STORE]

5. Press any key of the controller that becomes the Playback Master.

<span style="color:Red"> Not to be confused with the Master Controller, that can be only one at a time, the Playback Masters can be as many as needed.</span>


## Live Controller {#Live-Controller-11.5}


The Live Controller View is used to check and follow the playback of the Qlist, Chase or Scene loaded on the target controller.

As many Live Controller Views as needed may be added to the layout, and each of them can be focused on a specific controller.

The **Header** of the view reports the controller that is currently shown and the name of the object loaded on that controller.

<p align=center> ![11.5-Live-PB-Header](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FBjVVWHrSpO9zUutO5Pod%2F11.5-Live-PB-Header.webp?alt=media&token=74b27c41-01fd-48fe-846d-0dea2847e501) </p>

The **List button** enables/disables the automatic scrolling of the Cues.

The **Arrow button** shows or hides the empty columns (fields with no data).

The **Chain button** opens the Controller Selection popup.

<p align=center> ![11.5-PB-Selection](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FbVJMrYvWuXOcdmjeZQCu%2F11.5-PB-Selection.webp?alt=media&token=f1ab51a5-e694-4b4b-bb70-8ff64759e09c) </p>

The target controller that needs to be shown on the view can be selected from the list on the popup, divided per Controller Type, Page Number and Controller Number.

The **Master** key, when enabled, makes the Live Controller View follow the Master Controller.

The **Tabs** on the bottom of the Live Controller view switch between:

-   **Cue Sheet** - shows all the Cue's numbers, names, times and notes.

<p align=center> ![11.5-Live-PB-Cue-Sheet](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FJrLfVURsAjKRK8YnO2ZM%2F11.5-Live-PB-Cue-Sheet.webp?alt=media&token=054d9553-9754-4844-85a6-088d1fafabf9) </p>

ðŸ‘‰ Cue Sheet may be used to directly access the Cue's Timing popup by tapping on the desired time cell, either to rename the Cues by tammping on the Cue Name cell and digit the text on the keyboard.

## Teach Rate {#Teach-Rate-11.6}


Rate and Teach are the features designed to directly control the fading and looping speed of chasers and effects, and are very useful for live lighting playback.

**Rate** operates as a multiplier to linearly adjust the stored timing.

Rate can be assigned as a fader Action to any controller, splitted between Crossfade Rate (used with Chasers) and FX Rate (used with Effects).

Moreover the Rate button on the Controller Mode Keys sets all the sliders to control the rate.

**Teach** operates as a "tap beat" button to adjust the rate by giving timed inputs, according to the sound rhythm.

Teach can be assigned as a button Action to any controller and it affects both Chasers and Effects.

Additionally the Vibe panel offers two buttons dedicated to the Rate and Teach, used to open the **Rate Picker** on the Smart Screen and manage many playback rates at a time.

This screen view is very helpful in fine tuning chases and effects to synchronize with music or to improvise performances "on the fly".

The Rate Screen operates outside of the editor and is non destructive. Changes made in the Rate Screen are not stored in cues but may be stored and recalled in Snaps.

Press the \[RATE] button to open the Rate Picker on the Smart Screen.

<p align=center>**Smart Screen - Rate Picker**</p>
<p align=center> ![11.6-Rate-Picker](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FSlOxvR4LvBrEGIFs3wue%2F11.6-Rate-Picker.webp?alt=media&token=551939ea-d447-4aa0-9000-c4a97032cbd5) </p>

**Rate Screen**

- Press \[RATE] 

- All loaded controllers will appear in the "Selected Controllers" section of the smart screen. All loaded controllers will be shown and all controllers with Chasers or Effects running will be selected.
    
- Pressing any physical or virtual \[Key] of a controller, or tapping on the controller's box in the Rate screen, will deselect all other controllers. 

- Additional controllers may be toggled on or off as desired, they will appear in the Selected Controllers display. 
   
- {Select All} will select all loaded controllers on the rate control. 
  
- {Deselect All} will deselect all selected controllers from the rate control 
     
- {Show Active} will remove all controllers in the "Selected Controllers" section that are not currently under the control of the rate wheels.

**Encoder wheels**

1.  Wheel 1 - {Controller Rate} speeds up or slows down the cross fade rate of the controller. This may be used for cue transitions, chases, or effects. 
    Range: 0% (Stopped) âŸ¶ 3000% (effectively cut time)
    
2.  Wheel 2 - {X Fade %} adjusts the "fade vs jump" percent of a chaser. 
    Range: 0% (full jump) âŸ¶  100% (full cross fade)
    
3.  Wheel 3 - {Intensity Limit} proportionally limits the intensity output of a controller. 
    Range 0% (no intensity output) âŸ¶  100% {full intensity}
    
4.  Wheel 4 - {Library Editor Rate} adjusts the speed that Libraries are faded into the editor. <span style="color:Gray">Not implemented yet.</span>

Four virtual sliders on the Rate Picker allow the same control of the encoder wheels.

**Extra wheels**

1.  Wheel 1 - {FX Rate} adjusts the rate of effects that are running on the selected controllers.
    
2.  Wheel 2 - {FX Size} adjusts the size of effects that are running on the selected controllers.
    
3.  Wheel 3 - {FX Offset} adjusts the offset (Spread) of effects that are running on the selected controllers.
    
4.  Wheel 3 - {FX Base} adjusts the base values (start point) of parameters that are in running effects on the selected controllers.
    
**Reset keys**

1.  {Reset FX Rate} - Resets controlled FX rates back to their stored values.
    
2.  {Reset FX Size} - Resets controlled size of effects back to their stored values.
    
3.  {Reset FX Offset} - Resets controlled offset of effects back to their stored values.
    
4.  {Reset FX Base} - Resets controlled effects base values back to their stored values.
    
5.  {Reset Ctrl Rate} - Resets all controller rates back to their default of 100%.

**Freeze keys**

1.  {Freeze All} - Pauses all running chases and effects until the {Freeze All} key is toggled again.
    
2.  {Freeze Chase} - Pauses all running chases until the {Freeze Chase} key is toggled again.
    
3.  {Freeze Effect} - Pauses all running effects until the {Freeze Effect} key is toggled again.
    
> Freeze only affects chases and effects at the playback level, they are not released from the cue.

To indentify the Freezed Controllers, an indicator will appear on the controller's Status Box in place of the Rate value:

- FA for Freezed All

- FC for Freezed Chase

- FE for Freezed Effect

**Transport Bar**

When actively in the Rate Screen, physical controller keys are mapped to the rate interface and may not be used to activate Qlists, cues, or scenes. As an alternative, the transport bar may be used. To use the transport bar:

1.  Tap {Enable Controller PB} to activate the Transport Bar. (The controller keys are now active with the assigned functions).
    
2.  Select the controllers to control with the bar by toggling any of the controller's physical control keys
    
3.  Use the transport Bar buttons to:
    
-   {<<} Step Back
    
-   {|<} Back
    
-   {||} Hold (Pause)
    
-   {>} Go
    
-   {>>} Step Forward
    
4.  {Release} may be tapped at any time to deactivate the selected controllers using release time.
    
**Teach Rate**

<p align=center> ![11.6-Rate-&-Teach-Keys](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FGNG5gxys1j5DbGoIJztX%2F11.6-Rate-%26-Teach-Keys.webp?alt=media&token=7b467785-b797-4de7-ad96-826417cafb2c){height=100px} </p>

Teach may be used with the button on the Rate screen or with the \[TEACH] button on the panel.

1.  Set the number of taps to be averaged:

  - {TAPx2} for 2 taps - \[TEACH] button's LED becomes Red

  - {TAPx4} for 4 taps - \[TEACH] button's LED becomes Green

  - {TAPx8} for 8 taps - \[TEACH] button's LED becomes Blue

2.  Tap {Teach Rate} or press \[TEACH] the number of times defined.

  - {Teach Rate} will show the number of taps received.

  - \[TEACH] will blink until the total number of taps is reached.

3.  The selected controllers' rate will change accordingly to the average time between the pressures of Teach.

\[SHIFT] + \[TEACH] allows to switch between 2, 4 and 8 taps with no need to open the Rate Screen.
