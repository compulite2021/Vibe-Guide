This chapter deals with creating and triggering custom command sequences called Macros.

**The following is covered in this chapter:**

-  [13.1 Teach Macros](#Teach-Macros-13.1)
-  [13.2 Trigger Macros](#Trigger-Macros-13.2)
-  [13.3 Attach Macros](#Attach-Macros-13.3)
-  [13.4 Macro Time](#Macro-Time-13.4)


## Teach Macros {#Teach-Macros-13.1}


Macros can be created using the **Teach Macro** recorder. 
In future releases this will expand to include manually editable macros, where the macro time is automatically recorded with macros and the user may decide whether to enable time or ignore it.

**Store a Macro:**

1.  Press \[TEACH] - Vibe will enter Teach Macro record mode and the \[TEACH] key will flash red.
    
2.  Press editor keys or controller buttons as required.
    
3.  Press \[TEACH] again to terminate the recording - the \[TEACH] key will stop flashing and the key presses are now stored in the Macro clipboard.
    
4.  Press \[STORE] \[HERE] to a Macro Softkey. 

OR  Press \[MACRO] \[#] \[STORE] - The Macro is now stored.
    
5.  Press \[TEXT] to open the Text popup and label the Macro - this is only valid directly after storing the Macro, otherwise \[MACRO] \[#] \[TEXT] may be used at any time.

Macros may be viewed on the Exam view:
