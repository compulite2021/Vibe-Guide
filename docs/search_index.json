The following is covered in this chapter: 1.1. Unboxing 1.2. Getting Started 1.3. Guide Conventions 1.4. Important Terms 1.5 Releases 1.1 Unboxing TBA. 1.2 Getting Started Power requirements: Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz. Approximately 3.2 amps at 230V. Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country. Desk Light: Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console. Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Monitor intensity: - Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Power up the console: Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks. Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector. Press the Power button located at the upper right corner of the monitor panel above the USB connectors. The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch. Power down the console: Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open. Tap { Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} Pop-up will appear. Tap {Yes} or {No}. The Vibe application will shutdown and a screen will appear with the following options: {Shut Down the Console} - System will power off {Restart Vibe} - Vibe console application will restart {Open Offline Tool} - the Vibe utilities app will open. Hardware and software updates are preformed in the Offline Tools app. Choose Shut Down the Console - The console will safely power off. 1.3 Guide Conventions [XXXX] - Physical key {XXXX} - Soft key § [ ] { } - Example Press - Action applied to a physical key Tap - Action applied to softkey or virtual key Toggle - Action that actives and deactivates with alternating taps or presses Key - Any physical or virtual key that is NOT used for controller activation Button - Any virtual or physical key that is used to activate a controller Keypad - Embedded numeric keypad Keyboard - Consoles pull-out ASCII keyboard or any external keyboard SK - Object softkeys (Libraries, Groups, Snap, Macros, etc.)  - Hint or suggestion RED - Important information or Caution [Here] - Short form for Press an appropriate destination softkey or controller button to complete the command 1.4 Important Terms DMX 512 Output/Input Port - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter. DMX 512 Universe - Virtual DMX outputs 0  256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols.  Compulite VC protocol  w Art-Net 3 w  sACN SET = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets), 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures), 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors), 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures), 4 = Servers (Video servers), 5  1000 = User defined sets Parameter - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo. Controllers - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots. Submaster - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value. Master Controller - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys. Slider - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader. Qkey - A single button Controller. Assert - Takes back control of parameters that have been robbed by other controllers. HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence) - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications. LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence) - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output its values to the stage no matter what the value. [SELECT] - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller. Qlist - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999. Cue - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values. Scene - A look that exists independent of a Qlist. Library - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced. Options - Used to modify object properties on the fly Settings - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created. Cue Zero - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid. For the sake of this guide, Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function. 1.5 Releases Release Date: 06/09/2020 DB version: R_3.0 Desktop version: R_3.0 LPU version: R_3.0 HAL version: R_3.0 Device Pack version: DP_3.0 1.5.1 Bug Fixes Fixed a crash when removing a point from the Function editor Fixed a crash when searching Exam View and pressing SHIFT+RESET Fixed a potential crash on startup Fixed a potential crash on Undo popup Fixed potential crash on HAL Fixed a crash when pressing Actions on the Timeline view Fixed a crash when pressing apply on the Link Cue popup Fixed a crash on LPU when deleting a cue that is next on a PB and its values are active as Look Ahead Fixed a crash on LPU when releasing a playback during loop could cause it on some cases Fixed a crash on filters popup when deleting the last parameter from the list Fixed a crash when deleting a device that had no fixtures in the show Loading a big show could cause the system to get stuck Rem Dim could cause errors on DB Grab Active Master PB could cause errors on DB Live View - When parameter jumping is on its should works all the cases Performance fixes in specific sequences as well as general system speed Fixture selection was slow and caused many updates to small screen, especially when selecting with + When fixture has values, entering to Blind editor where the values there are at home, will make a graphic flick Exclude from Snap and Exclude from Override did not work correctly Snaps stored with these options need to be rebuilt!

Bank Mode 4.7.3. Fixture Mode 4.1 Introduction Vibe uses a Multi-touch based interface with simple familiar gestures for navigation. Supported gestures:  Two fingers for swipe and scrolling.  One finger select.  Multi-selection via shaped gestures.  Multi-selection via window. Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added using DisplayPort 1.2 or higher MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large 21 embedded screen is general-purpose like the external monitors. The smaller 11.6 Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive parameter information such as color pickers and gobo pickers. Each monitor, (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain one Window Frame. Window frames can contain one of three Workspace Templates. Each Template has a dedicated display in the lower area. This area will have different fixed options and information depending on the selected Workspace Template. The remainder of the template may be freely customized by the user. Each Template can contain up to 4 Pages that can be toggling using the WorkSpace Template Keys or by tapping the yellow {VIBE} Menu key at the bottom left of each Workspace Template and tapping the {PAGES} key to the right of the {VIBE} key to open the pages display. Each Monitor (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain its own independent set of WorkSpace Templates. Workspace Templates are organized into three familiar categories, each with a dedicated display key. These keys are found above the top left corner of the Smart Screen:  PATCH  [PROG] - (Program)  [PLAY-B] - (Playback Controllers) The Workspace Template Keys are specific to the monitor that has focus (last touched or selected via a mouse). The Patch Template by default has a fixed command line and patch tool bar at the bottom, and a pre-built patch display on page 1. Except for the bottom toolbar, the patch display may be freely customized via the {VIBE} Menu. The Program Template contains a command line and fixed display of the 15 motorized Slider controllers. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the {VIBE} Menu. The controller display may be toggled to display the Qkey controller display using the [SWAP DISPLAY] key at the top left corner of the controller panel. The Playback Template contains a command line and a fixed display of both the 15 motorized fader controllers and the 15 Qkey controllers at the same time. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the {VIBE} Menu. The controller displays may be swapped to display the Qkey controllers on the bottom row via the [SWAP DISPLAY] key at the top left corner of the controller panel. 4.2 {VIBE} Menu The {VIBE} Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped sub-menus. It is used to access common system functions such as Save and System Settings as well as configure Workspace Template displays. Configuring WorkSpaces: When configuring workspaces, any object at the end of the hierarchical sub-menu can be tapped to open its object on a blank portion of the current workspace or dragged and dropped to the workspace surface. Once on the surface it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. If an object is dragged on top of another both will turn green and become one tabbed object. To edit the placement of objects, the {Lock} icon beside the {VIBE} menu key must be toggled to unlock the workspace display. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the display and allow normal usage. 4.3 Layouts Layouts: After all workspaces and associated pages are configured, the display configurations of the workspaces can be saved to a Layout by tapping the {VIBE} Menu and then the {LAYOUT} key. A Sub-menu will open with options to {SAVE LAYOUT}, {LOAD LAYOUT}. After configuring external monitors, a layout should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layouts remember the configuration of external monitors and a warning message will appear if the system is booted without the expected external monitor. 4.4 Smart Screen The 11.6 multi-touch monitor embedded in the upper section of the Vibe console is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive bank, wheel, and parameter information. For more detail see: 9.3.4 Smart Screen 4.5 Toolbars The Editor Toolbar contains is a set of interactive Softkeys that are used to access less common commands: The Patch Toolbar contains two pages of options:  Idle state toolbar  Fixture selection state toolbar 4.6 Live Display Vibe has two ways to display parameter data: 1. Live Display - Displays cue and editor data as a spreadsheet. 2. Live Parameter Display - shows values in a table format instead of spreadsheet format. Live Display The Live Display has a number of options that may be set under the Options field: - Opens Live View Settings. (See 4.6.1.Live View Settings.) Fit - Opens column width options.  Fit to Window  Fit to Value  Fix by Text  Default Active on Stage - Only parameter columns that are selected in the editor or have values derived from the active stage look are shown. All others are hidden. Sets - Select which of the fixture sets to display.  Fixture s Channel  Spot s Matrix  Media Server  Other custom Sets if created Format - Controls what format the data is displayed in.  % - Values in percentage  Decimal - DMX values 0  255  Text - Parameter step text  Text + Percentage 4.7 Live Parameter Display Live View Settings pop-up - Display Tab. Live View Scheme - Parameter columns may be freely added, removed, moved in using the Live View Scheme. Move columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt; } or {&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column forward or backwards. Move columns to the first or last column position: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings &gt; the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt;&lt; } or {&gt;&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column first position or last position. Remove columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings the green indicator light will turn on. Tap the {Remove} key. Dock - Locks the column scroll at the end of the parameter column that is docked. A red line will show on the live display to show the dock position. (Group By Banks and All icons in 1 cell are not implemented yet) Add Columns - Columns are added using the Banks section of the pop-up. Select a bank - All parameters for the bank will appear in the box adjacent to the banks. Select the parameter or parameters to add to the live display.  Swipe in the the parameter box to browse hidden parameters. Tap a parameter that is not already selected in green and it will be added to the end of the column list. Parameter keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching the parameter will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. Use the {|&lt; } or {&gt;|} {|&lt;&lt; } or {&gt;&gt;|} to position the column. Interactive Icons:  Adds or removes the icon columns. Interactive Icon keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. General:  Global Fixture Number - Fixtures hidden unique system number.  Fixture Layer Number - Adds or removes Fixture Number column.  Fixture Name - Adds or removes Fixture Name column. Fixture # and Fixture Name are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. Live View Settings pop-up - Behavior Tab Fixture Jumping:  Off  Jump if needed - live display pages the display to show the selected fixtures if they are not shown on the current live page.  Lowest Selection to Top - Jumps the lowest fixture number of the selection to the top of the live display. Parameter Jumping:  Jumps the parameters column and related bank parameters to the end of the dock position. (First scrollable column). Interactive Fixture Selection:  Turns on the ability to make fixture selections from the live display grids. Interactive Cell Editing:  Turns on the ability to directly edit cells in the live display grid. Interactive Header selection - Currently implemented but may not be turned off.  Enables parameters to be directly selected from the live display headers. Submaster Values:  Show Stored Values - Dimmer parameters under the control of Group Submasters will continue to show their stored values and the icon will also be shown to indicate when the parameter is inhibited.  Show Output Values - When the Submaster is pulled down, the actual dimmer output values will be shown in the live display dimmer column. 4.8 Parameter Mode Unlike most theatrical consoles, parameters other than dimmer may be shown in Live Parameter Mode. Parameters visible in Live Parameter Mode are filtered using the Parameter View Settings Pop-up. Filter Parameters: Tap the icon - The Parameter View Settings pop-up will open. Tap parameters on either side to move them from one box to the other. Close the pop-up using [ENTER] or 4.9 Bank Mode Fixtures may also be graphically displayed by banks. Currently, three banks can be graphically viewed: Image will be implemented soon. Intensity - In the form of an illuminated disk. Position - In the form of a cursor that moves in a black rectangle representing the stage. Color - In the form of a circular color swatch - Color wheels are not currently supported. 4.10 Fixture Mode Graphically Displays Intensity, Position, and Color parameter icons as a single tombstone fixture "],["file-management.html", "Chapter 5 File Management 5.1 Show Menu 5.2 Load Vector Show", " Chapter 5 File Management This chapter provides an overview of Vibes Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Configuring Physical DMX 1/0 6.6. Patching Inputs 6.7. Parking Addresses and Fixtures 6.1 Fixture Sets Like other lighting consoles, Vibe contains an extensive Device Library with DMX parameter mapping for fixtures, media servers, and common miscellaneous devices like smoke machines. Before a device can be programmed it must be imported and patched to DMX addresses. Vibe has an advanced numbering system that allows devices to be grouped into five familiar categories called SETS. Custom SETS may also be created. Numbering in all sets may be freely changed if there are no overlapping numbers. Each Set has a unique ID. Set ID numbers: 0 = [Fixture] is a special global numbering set that must also reference one of the other sets. All devices must be assigned a Fixture number and one of the other set numbers. 1 = [Channel] is a numbering set that would normally be used for conventional single parameter devices. 2 = [SPOT] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for multi-parameter devices like moving lights. 3 = [MATRIX] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for RGB or other non-moving LED fixtures. (also useful in pixel mapping devices) 4 = [SERVER] is a numbering system used for media servers. Each SET may have Fixtures numbered from 1  999999 To patch a device, you must first move focus to the main monitor and press the PATCH Workspace Template key. By default, the first page will contain all the displays needed for patching. 6.2 Import Devices Once the Patch Workspace is open: Make sure the {Imported Devices} tab just above the white FIXTURE selection display area at the bottom left of the workspace is selected. Tap {Import}, the Manufactures picker list will appear. Flick or drag along the list to browse to the desired manufacturer then tap the manufacturers name. A new list and search window will open. If the exact device name is known, type it in the search window, if not flick or drag to browse the list until the desired device is found. The &lt; key may be pressed at any time to return to the Imported Devices list. . 6.3 Advanced Search Fixtures may be searched directly by name using the Advanced Device Search. Searches may also be filtered by parameter order and DMX Channel Count to limit the search. The filters are very helpful in finding close matches for fixtures that are not currently in the device library. To access Advanced Search: Tap {Import} from the main page - The tab will now read {Advanced Search}. Tap {Advanced Search} - The Advanced Search Pop-up will appear. Type the fixtures name in the Fixture Name box or Set the filters to limit the selection. Select the fixture from under the Matching Devices header. The DMX Modes pop-up will open. Review the DMX implementation and select the desired mode. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and add the fixture to the Imported Devices list. 6.4 Create and Patch imported fixtures Import the desired device. (See 6.2. Import Devices). The device will now be in the list below the Imported Devices header. Tap the device you wish to patch and the Create and Patch Fixtures popup will appear. In the Create and Patch fixtures pop-up, type the quantity in the red highlighted field via the keypad or flick/drag to browse the list until the desired quantity number is found then tap the number. If the Quantity number is not highlighted in Red, tap the field to make it active. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap in the {SET} field. The appropriate SET for the selected fixture should automatically be selected, but as some fixtures dont always cleanly fit into standard categories, check that the correct Set is selected. If not, flick/drag to browse to the correct SET then tap it. You may also type the Set number (0-5). Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the {Set Number} field. Set the Channel, Spot, Matrix, or Server number for the fixture in the red highlighted field using the keypad or scroll to browse the list until the desired start number is found, then tap the number.  By default, the first available number for the selected SET is pre-assigned. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any box in the Fixture Number field to select it. By default, the same number as the SET Number will appear as the Fixture Number. Many users like to group Fixtures by 10s or 100s so it is common to type 101 for the start of one type of fixture, 201 for a second type and so on. The SET number and Fixture number do not have to be the same. Next to the Fixture Number field is a data entry box that displays the fixtures default short name. This may be edited at any time while in this pop-up. The name will be updated when the fixtures are created upon closing the pop-up. In the second section of the pop-up, fixtures that were selected for creation can be patched via the DMX patch wizard. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap a number in the UNIVERSE field. If the desired universe is not visible, flick/drag to browse to the correct universe number then tap it. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any number in the ADDRESS field. By default, the interval between fixtures of the same type is fixed. Using the INTERVAL field, a custom interval may be set. To complete CREATE and PATCH tap the {APPLY &amp; CONTINUE} key in the bottom right corner of the pop-up, Press [ENTER], or tap to close the pop-up and return to the patch workspace. Theatrical Multi-Patching can also be done manually using keypad syntax:  Toggle off the {MAIN PATCH} key at the top of the DMX patch wizard before closing the pop-up. The fixtures will be created but will remain unpatched. To Patch fixtures using traditional keypad syntax:  [FIXTURE] [#] [ADDRESS] [#].[#] ( By default, the first available DMX address of the selected Universe will be shown in the ADDRESS field. If the default start address is not appropriate, type or scroll the list to the desired start address and tap it.Universe.Address), [STORE]. Or  [ADDRESS] [#].[#] +/ -  [#].[#] [FIXTURE] [#] [STORE]. Addresses may also be typed in absolute format: 1  32,768 (64 Universes standard). The system will automatically assign the correct universe When starting from a {New Show} only {Physical DMX outputs} are enabled. Network universes must be enabled in PATCH {DMX Settings} 6.4.1 Drag and Drop Patch Drag and Drop Patch - If {Main Patch} is toggled off in the Create and Patch pop-up, fixtures can be created but not patched. Created fixtures may then be dragged and dropped onto the Universe View. Drag and Drop from the Fixtures tab: Create fixtures - (See 6.4. Create and patch imported fixtures). Select the Fixture Set you wish to patch from in the lower right of the main patch workspace. Select the Fixtures tab on the left side of the main patch workspace directly above the white FIXTURE selection box. A list of created fixtures will appear. Make sure the Universes View tab at the bottom of the main patch workspace is selected. Select a destination Universe from the Universes list in the top right of the main patch workspace. - Scroll the list to browse for hidden universes. Press and Hold a fixture, it will turn into a floating icon of the fixture. Drag the fixture icon from the Fixtures list onto the Universe View grid. All associated DMX addresses for the fixture will turn green. Drop the fixture icon on the desired DMX start address for the fixture. - The fixture is now patched. Multiple fixtures may be selected by swiping  or  in the Fixtures list. Make multiple selections of fixtures using the keypad: Type a range of fixtures using the keypad - the fixture selection will be displayed numerically in the white fixture selection box. Press and Hold anywhere in the white fixture selection box - a fixture icon will appear. Drag the icon to the Universe View grid and drop it at the destination start address - the range of fixtures is now patched. Multi-Patch using Drag and Drop: Drag and drop the same fixture to multiple DMX offsets. All types of fixtures may be multi-patched but caution should be used when multi-patching multi-parameter fixtures. Unpatch fixtures using drag and drop: Press and Hold any patched DMX offset - The DMX addresses for the fixtures patched to it will turn green and a fixture icon will be shown. Drag the selected block of fixtures towards the bottom of the screen - a waste basket icon will appear at the bottom of the workspace. Drag the block until the fixture icon is over the waste basket and release the fixture - the fixture will now be unpatched. 6.4.2 Modify Patch Once patched fixtures can be modified using keypad syntax or using the two Patch Toolbars in the Patch Workspace. Toolbar with no fixture selection:  {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens up Clear Patch pop-up.  {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up.  {ADD FIXTURE} - Opens the Create And Patch pop-up.  {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens up Delete Fixtures pop-up. Toolbar with fixture selection:  [FIXTURE] [#] {PATCH} - Opens up Patch Fixture pop-up.  [FIXTURE] [#] {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up with fixture already selected.  [FIXTURE] [#] {FIXTURE CALIBRATION} - Opens up Fixture Calibration pop-up with the fixture selected. See: 20. XYZ Fixture Calibration  [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens the Clear Patch confirmation popup  [FIXTURE] [#] {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens the Delete Fixture confirmation pop-up Modify the patch using keypad syntax:  [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - From the Editor toolbar.  [FIXTURE] [#] [DELETE] - Only works in the Patch Workspace. 6.5 Configuring Physical DMX 1/0 By default, DMX is mapped to the physical ports on a 1:1 basis. DMX is always transmitted but can be remapped to anyone of the supported 256 DMX universes. Remap Physical outputs: With no fixtures selected, tap {DMX SETTINGS} on the patch toolbar - The DMX Properties pop-up will open. In the Protocol column, Tap {Physical output}. Under the Source Universe heading, tap the desired source universe number or once red type the universe number you wish to be the source. Under the Physical output Destination Universe heading, tap one of the 8 displayed physical outputs - the source Universe will now be patched to the output. Change output to input - Currently, Vibe supports 2 inputs but multiple connectors may be assigned to the same input. Tap a patched output - Two additional options will appear below the Output Destination Universe box.  {Make Input 1} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 1. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input.  {Make Input 2} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 2. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. Change input back to output: Tap a patched input - an additional Make Output option will appear below the Output Destination Universe box. Tap {Make Output} - The Connector will now output DMX. Change DMX refresh rate:  Vibe will always transmit DMX at the fastest refresh rate it can (38 - 44Hz). Sometimes older equipment cannot handle the high refresh rate, so it may be reduced using the DMX Max Rate wheel. It is not recommended to go below 28Hz as some jitter may be observed. 6.6 Patching Inputs The following objects may be mapped to DMX inputs: - DMX input mapped directly to the consoles DMX outputs - DMX input mapped to Macros - DMX input mapped to Controllers - DMX input mapped to fixtures Map a DMX output to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [ADDRESS] [#] Press [STORE] E.g. [ADDRERSS] [1] {INPUT PATCH TO} [ADDRESS] [1] [STORE] - When DMX 1 is received from an external source like a console, DMX 1 will directly output to the Vibes DMX output. No values will be shown in the live display as no actual parameters are involved. Map a range of DMX outputs to a range of DMX inputs: Press [ADDRESS] [#]  [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [ADDRESS] [#]  [#] Press [STORE] Map a Macro to a DMX input - Macro will trigger at 50% Press [ADDRESS] [#].[#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [MACRO] [#] Press [STORE] Map a controller to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [PLAY-B] (Controller) - The Controller Selection pop-up will appear. Choose the Controller Type, Page Number, and Controller number from the pop-up. Press ENTER, or tap to close the pop-up and complete the patch. Map a Fixture to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [Fixture] [#] Press [STORE] DMX inputs will automatically be mapped to all the fixtures parameters starting at the specified address. [ADDRESS] [1] [FIXTURE] [1] (A fixture with 42 parameters) [STORE] will automatically match the 42 parameters to input addresses 1  42. The next fixture would have to be mapped starting at address 43. Delete a DMX Input patch assignment: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [DELETE] 6.7 Parking Addresses and Fixtures Park an Address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park pop-up will appear. Set a DMX level from 0  255 using tee virtual slider. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and park the address. Unpark and address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park pop-up will appear. Tap {Clear Park}. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and unpark the address. Park a fixture: [FIXTURE] [#] - Set parameter values in the editor. Tap {PARK} on the editor toolbar.

System 7.1 Editing System Settings defaults are accessed by selecting {System Settings} from the {Vibe} menu or by tapping the {System Status} area at the far right side of the controller displays. Editing Properties - Editing Section Default Stage Value: Home Value - When released, fixtures parameters will return to their home values as specified in the devices definition or user Home Scene. Maintain Last Value - When released, fixture parameters will remain at their current position but dimmer will go out. Auto Parameter Grouping: When on, parameters are grouped as follows: Clear Editor After Store: Default editor behaviour when in Compulite Mode - After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until [RESET] or [VIBE]+[RESET] is pressed. Editor Flash: Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature. {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values) Defaults - {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%) Apply Compulite Mode: - Sets a number of defaults to emulate traditional nontracking Compulite Mode. Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value} {Clear Editor After Store} = Off {Advance To Cue After Store} = Off Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking} Editing Properties: - Cueing Section Tracking - Non-Tracking: Tracking On:  Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values. Non-Tracking:  Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero. In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the Store Options {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors. Clear Editor on Master GO: The editor will be reset when GO on the Master Controller is pressed. Store Scene by Default: By default [STORE] [HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue. Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax [STORE] [CUE] [HERE] (press any controller button). Next Cue Increment: When [Store] [Here], [STORE] [STORE], or [STORE] [ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used. E.g. If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20. Editing Properties: - ON Value Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the [ON] key is pressed. {First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing [ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default. Restore and Save Defaults: {Restore Popup Positions} - Currently redundant. {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set. {Restore Factory} - Restores console to read only defaults. {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to show specific defaults without exiting the pop-up. 7.2 Timing Timing Properties - Cue Section Default Back Time: Timing is used when the [Back] or [Hold Back] Buttons are pressed. Default Assert: Timing is used when a controllers parameters are reasserted with the [ASSERT] [HERE] command. Use Cue Time - As the Assert command is basically a GOTO command to the same cue that is active, the cue time for the cue being reasserted may be used instead of the Default Assert time. Default GOTO Time: Default timing when the GOTO command is used. GOTO time can be overridden using command [GOTO] [CUE] [#] [TIME] [Value]Press or [ENTER]. Default Release Time: Default Fade out time for parameters being released from the editor using the [RESET], parameter [RELEASE] keys, or Controllers being released from the stage (turned off) using the controller [RELEASE] button. Look Ahead Section: Set all controllers on will enable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Set all controllers off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Once all is set on, individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time. Once all off, individual controllers may be enabled Look Ahead at any time. Timing Properties - Snap Section: Default fade time for all controllers being initiated by the Snap. Timing Properties - Snap Section: Default fade time for all controllers being initiated by the Snap. Timing Properties - System Time Section: System Time (Editor Time) is applied to values being introduced into the editor and other miscellaneous features that do not otherwise have their own timing settings. 7.3 Network Network Properties - Local Local: Set local console IP Console State: The unique name is assigned to the console to help identify it in the partners list.

"],["programming-concepts.html", "Chapter 8 Programming Concepts 8.1 Operational Philosophy 8.2 Command Syntax 8.3 Command Line", " Chapter 8 Programming Concepts The following is covered in this chapter: 8.1. Operational Philosophy 8.2. Command Syntax 8.3. Command Line 8.1 Operational Philosophy The Vibe is an advanced lighting control system designed to simplify programming in all styles of Entertainment lighting. Abstraction: To simplify programming, Vibe uses an abstract layer that allows fixtures of different hardware types to be presented to the user in a universal way. The dedicated graphical Smart Screen presents global pickers for most parameters including:  HSV color picker (Hue, Saturation, Intensity)  P/T XYZ Trackpad  Blade picker  Beam picker for Iris, Zoom, Focus and Frost effects  General slider picker for GOBO, Color, Prism, and Animation wheels  Intensity picker for common intensity values and strobe effects Real World Units: Where possible picker values are displayed in Real World units  XYZ P/T in degrees  Strobe in HZ  Color in HSV 0-360 degrees  Zoom in degrees Virtual Parameters: To make it easier to work with fixtures using different color systems and XYZ tracking systems, Vibe creates virtual parameters that may not exist in the physical fixture. Examples would be:  HSV - As a common denominator for CMY, RGB, and Multi color LED fixtures such as RGBA, ETC Seven color, RGBW.  Virtual Intensity - For controlling LED fixtures that do not have a dimmer parameter.  XYZ - for calibration of fixtures that only have a physical Pan/Tilt Tracking: Vibe by default is a Tracking console and follows the conventions of modern theatrical consoles. Vibe also has a special track feature called SKIP. If cues are modified using SKIP, instead of Qonly, the relationship with the original hard value is maintained, and changes to the original value Skip over the modification and preserve the track. Qonly Mode: Not implemented globally Modifications, insertions and deletions will be done Qonly by default Move fades will still be valid Non - Tracking Compulite Mode - Defaults are changed to: Tracking turned off. The Editor is not cleared after a Store. After Reset, Editor values remain at their last position instead of returning to home values. (Compulite Gray tracking) Controllers do not advance after a Store. Color spaces: The Vibe can work in three color spaces:  HSV - Color for all types of fixtures can be set using the Color picker or the HSV parameter wheels. HSV virtual parameters are stored in Cues and Libraries just like physical parameters. Automatically CMY or RGB values (depending on the fixture type) will be displayed but not directly referenced in cues using HSV.  RGB - If color values are set using the physical RGB parameters, those values are stored in the cue and HSV values will be displayed but not directly referenced .  CMY - If color values are set using the CMY parameters, those values are stored in the cue and HSV values will be displayed but not directly referenced. Color crossfading: Currently, color crossfading is done using the physical color parameters. In future release it will be possible to crossfade HSV using predefined vectors Maintain Selection: To avoid constantly reselecting fixtures after a STORE command, Vibe maintains its selection on reset of the editor. To clear the editor and selection, [VIBE] (Shift) + [RESET] must be pressed. 8.2 Command Syntax Vibe uses a hybrid command syntax. When dealing with keypad command line driven operations, the logic is: Source Objects  Filters  Options  Command Completes. (Action Completes Mode) e.g. [Group 1] [Full] [Library 2 (Position) 1] [Enter] [Cue 1] [Store Options] {Red + White} [Store] For softkeys and controllers where touching the object completes the sequence, the logic is: Source Object, Filter, Command, Options, Destination Object Completes (Here Mode) Completes {GROUP} [1][Full], [LIBRARY] {Position} [3] [Store] [Store Options] {Red Only} [Press any [Button] on Slider Controller 1]. 8.3 Command Line The Command Line is the area where commands appear as they are entered. When in Live it is bounded in grey on the big monitor and blue on the small monitor. When in BLIND, both command lines are bounded in yellow. Commands may be backspaced using the Clear Entry [CE] key, The command line can be clear back to the beginning using the [CLEAR] key ([VIBE]+[CE]) Command are also augmented with the interactive toolbar beside the command line on the big screen.

[Fixture] [1] [] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [1] - would select fixtures 1,4,7,10,13 (as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/1 will be displayed on the command line). [Fixture] [1] [] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [2] - would select fixtures 2,5,8,11,14 (as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/2 will be displayed on the command line). 9.2.2 Transpose Transpose is accessed from the Editor Toolbar. It is used to reorder fixture selection based on a specified offset. This is particularly useful in creating interesting effects and fanning. E.g. 1: Fixture 1  12 {Transpose} 2 [ENTER] = 1+3+5+7+9+11+2+4+6+8+10+12 E.g. 2: Fixture 1  12 {Transpose} 3 [ENTER] = 1+4+7+10+2+5+8+11+3+6+9+12 E.g. 3: Fixture 112 {Transpose} 4 [ENTER] = 1+5+9+2+6+10+3+7+11+4+8+12 9.2.3 Pattern Is accessed from the Editor Toolbar. It can be used prior to entering the Advanced Effects editor to create more complex block patterns that are available using the basic {Block Of} and {Sub-Block Of} key in the effects editor. To set a pattern: Make a fixture selection Tap {Pattern} on the Editor Toolbar - The Pattern pop-up will open.  This is not an effect even though it is a dynamic display. Tap the indicator at the top of the displayed fixtures. - it should turn white. Select a number under the Block Size header. Tap the {Spread} icon. The fixture columns will expand to show the new fixture order. If desired make further order changes under the Offset Header and tap {offset} icon. Make further modifications or reset the selection with the {Reset} {Invert} {transpose} and {Invert Columns} keys. Once finished, exit the pop-up by pressing or [ENTER]. Open the Advanced Effects editor and program the desired effect. See: 13.3. Advanced Effects Editor Simple Block and Sub Block groupings may be created within both Effects Editors. The pattern is for advanced blocks and groupings 9.2.4 Fan Mode Vibe has two methods to fan fixture parameters: Using the [Fan] key and interface. Using keypad syntax. See: 9.3.7. Fixture Selection (Detailed) Using [Fan] Mode: Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode. Select a Function from the sliding picker. Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode. Selecting a different parameter will also turn Fan mode off. Common Fan Functions are : {Fade In} / = lowest to highest {Fade Out}  = highest to lowest {Diagonal} -/- = Standard PAN Fan {Saw Tooth} / = Mirror lowest on ends to highest in middle {Mirror} / = Highest on ends to lowest in middle Function types may be freely changes while in Fan Mode to audition various results. Any Function created in the Function Editor of the Advanced Effect Editor may be applied to Fan Block of and Sub Blocks: Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode. Select a Function from the sliding picker. Select Blocks of {#} Select Sub Blocks {#} Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode. Examples of Blocks and Sub Blocks: {Fade In} - Blocks of 1 and no Sub Block {Fade In} - Blocks of 4 no Sub Blocks {Fade In} - Blocks of 6, Sub Blocks of 2 {Saw Tooth} - (Low-High Mirror) Blocks of 12, Sub Blocks 2 Moving Light Fixture with {Fade In} Dimmer and Color Fan, and {Diagonal} Pan Fan Instead of fanning Blocks based on the selection, fixture Groups may also be used as Blocks. To Fan Blocks By Groups: Using the Group SKs or using the keypad, select the Groups to be fanned Tap {Blocks By Group} Use any of the above methods to fan parameters by Group Parameters may also be fanned using keypad syntax. Fixture Selection (Detailed) 9.2.5 Highlight Mode Highlight and Lowlight modes are used to help identify the positions of fixtures so that they may be edited more easily. Highlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - Full Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked To Highlight fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using keypad or using Groups. Press [H.LIGHT] - The key will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will remain highlighted and all other fixtures will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [H.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. Highlight/Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection To swap new fixtures into Highlight: Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped. Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection. The Highlight may be customized when the default home values are too generic. Users may want to tighten the zoom or use a specific iris as a fixtures default. To create a custom Highlight Scene: Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [STORE] The Highlight Scene only affects the active fixture. To Delete the Highlight Scene: Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [DELETE] 9.2.6 Lowlight Mode Lowlight mode is used when many fixtures are lit up and therefore Highlight is not helpful. Lowlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - 30% all fixtures except active fixture which will be at 100% Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked. Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked Unlike Highlight, Lowlight maintains a value of 30% for dimmers while active. To Lowlight fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using the keypad or using Groups. Press [L.LIGHT] - All dimmer parameters will go to 30%. [L.LIGHT] will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All other fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will go to a dimmer value of 100% and all other fixtures dimmer values will remain at 30%. Other parameters will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [L.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. 9.2.7 Remainder Dim {Rem Dim} REM DIM is an Editor Tool commonly used in theatre environments but can be useful in many other situations. {REM DIM} Toggles all dimmer values to 0 except those that are selected. If no value is given in the editor, the selected fixtures will maintain their current values and not create a hard move. While in {REM DIM}, [Next]/[Prev] will swap the Rem Dim fixture forwards or backwards. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made followed by {REM DIM} all unselected fixtures will go to 0. The selected fixtures will not be changed or entered into the editor. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made, [Next]/[Prev] will force all but the first fixture in the selection to 0. The next press of [Next]/[Prev] will force the first fixture to 0 and release the next fixture. Fixtures in the selection will continue to swap from 0 to release with each press of [Next]/[Prev]. Pressing REM DIM again toggles the feature off and restores the stage look. Cues may be stored with {REM DIM} on but once stored, {REM DIM} is turned off. 9.2.8 Home Scene By default released fixtures return to their home values as defined by the devices fixture profile. The device profile is usually based on the manufacturers suggested defaults, but sometimes the defaults are not appropriate. Vibe allows users to customize Home Values by building a Home Scene. When a fixture is programmed in a Home Scene it will take preference over its home values in the device profile. Create a Home Scene: Program fixtures in the editor to values that will work best as home values. Press [SCENE] [HOME] [STORE] - When released fixtures will now use the Home Scene as a reference. Delete a Home Scene: Press [SCENE] [HOME] [DELETE] - Home values will return to the device profiles home values. 9.3 Working with Fixtures Working with Fixtures: 9.3.1.

Release and Home Sequences 9.3.1 Fixture Selection basics Fixtures are selected using the [FIXTURE] key on the keypad. They also may be stored and recalled using the [GROUP] key. Fixtures may also be interactively selected via the Live Display or Live Parameter Display. [+] [-]  keys are valid with Fixture selections and Groups. [FIXTURE]  (period) - Reselects the last selection. [FIXTURE]  - Reselects all fixtures in the Editor. [CE] - Backspaces the command line one character at a time but currently will not go back one command at a time. [VIBE]+[CE/CLEAR] - Clears the command line to the beginning and ideal tee system. [RELEASE]:  First press releases the active parameters (last adjusted) for selected fixtures.  Second press releases all remaining parameters for selected fixtures from the Editor. [DE SEL] - Deselects all fixtures but maintains values in the Editor. This function is usually used to protect the operator from accidentally adjusting parameters in the Editor when they are temporarily captured. It may also be used to idle the command line to allow [TEXT] {SK} function while fixtures are still in the Editor. [RESET] - Releases all parameters from the Editor. [VIBE]+[RESET] - Releases all parameters from the Editor and releases all selected fixtures. [NEXT]/ [PREV] - Increments or decrements fixtures in a selection. When used with a Group, will be confined to the fixtures in the Group. Trackball [X LOCK] / [Y LOCK] - Locks the X or Y axis of the trackball. [RES] - Sets global encoder resolution. Blue = Low 8 bit, Green = Medium 10 bit (Default) Red = High 16 bit. Holding the [VIBE] key down while turning an encoder temporarily sets the encoder to high resolution 16 bit. Vibe uses a precision algorithm for encoders. Based on the starting resolution, the slower an encoder is turned, the more resolution it has. 9.3.2 What are Parameters Parameters are any features of a device that may be manipulated and stored in an object. Examples of parameters would be: Dimmer Pan/Tilt Cyan/Yellow/Magenta Zoom Gobo 1 Blade Rotate In Vibe parameters are organized under six standard Banks and one special Bank: Intensity Position Color Beam Image Shape Control A special bank as its parameters is not stored in cues. Iaete d it eeade re l tmel meee gee to ffturee coatrol fuactoae) Parameter values may be set using either Vibes intuitive Smart Screen picker system or conventional parameter wheels and keypad method. 9.3.3 Virtual Parameters See: 8.1. Virtual Parameters 9.3.4 Smart Screen The 11.6 multi-touch monitor directly above the 4 encoder wheels is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying: Context sensitive interactive bank, and parameter information. Encoder wheel displays. Playback information for the controllers that are directly above it. Special pop-ups for Libraries, Store options and Grab functions. A simplified Effects editor. Displays for Fan feature. The Smart Screen is divided into six sections: Smart Screen - Intensity Bank The Context sensitive area changes depending on the bank and fixture type. Where possible, similar parameters from different fixture types will be presented to the user using Vibes universal fixture model. This means that is not necessary to memorize the manufacturers specification of each fixture, as all fixtures are programmed in a similar consistent way. Smart Screen - Position Bank Smart Screen - Color Bank Smart Screen - Beam Bank Smart Screen - Image Bank Smart Screen - Shape Bank Smart Screen - Control Smart Screen Preferences: Settings:  Home - Returns menus to Settings level.  Format - Sets the view format for wheel displays.  Percent  Decimal  Text  Text + Percent  Resolution - Sets the Global wheel resolution. This may also be set by toggling the [Res] key over the trackball  8 bit - Blue on [Res] Key  10 bit - Green on [Res] key  12 bit - Red on [Res] key  16 bit - Yellow on [Res] key  24 bit - Magenta on [Res] key  View - Sets behaviour of smart screen views.  Auto - Shows programming display when there are fixtures in the editor, and shows the controller displays for Aux Qkeys and Global Sliders when the editor is cleared.  Programming - Maintains the programming display even with the editor released.  Playbacks - Maintains the playback controller display even with fixtures in the editor. Wheels and wheel displays remain accessible.  Wheel Picker Display Modes:  Smart - All wheels for the selected fixture are shown in the interactive wheel picker area.  Parameter Steps - Pressing a parameter wheel or tapping the wheel display above it will display a picker list of all feature steps for the selected fixture.  Extra Wheels - Displays wheel information for the additional context sensitive encoder wheels Smart Screen Effects Editor - See: 13.2. Smart Screen Effects Editor 9.3.5 Adjusting Parameters using the Wheel Picker Smart Screen Picker Programming  To adjust fixture wheel parameter values: (Interactive Wheel Picker method) Select the fixtures to program Swipe or Drag the Wheel Picker on the right-hand side of the Smart Screen and browse to the wheel and slot you want to program. Common wheels are:  Color Wheel  Static Gobo Wheel  Rotating Gobo Wheel  Animation Wheel  Prism Wheel Tap the wheel slot you wish to program and the context sensitive area or the Smart Screen will open with the appropriate picker. Adjust the virtual controls as needed. Most virtual controls are also mapped to the 4 physical wheels To adjust parameter values: (standard programming method) Select the fixtures to program. Tap the {BANK} key of the parameter you wish to adjust. Banks may contain more than 4 wheels of parameters. Tapping the desired {BANK} key again, pages to the next set of 4 parameter wheels. The Assigned parameter wheel function is displayed on the Wheel Display at the bottom of the Smart Screen directly above the wheels. Rotate the large push wheel encoder of the parameter you wish to adjust. Values may be added directly from the keypad by:  Pushing a parameter wheel downward to select the parameter.  AT will appear on the command line  Type a value from Zero  Full. @ is only used for the dimmer parameter. A Parameter value must be entered in 2 digits or one digit and the [Enter] key for whole numbers. E.g. 05, 50, 5 [ENTER] =50 9.3.6 Grab Grab is a powerful tool for selecting fixtures that meet a number of conditions. By default GRAB selects all fixtures with intensity or virtual intensity values above Zero Pressing GRAB without a selection opens up a pop-up on the Smart Screen. It contains the following options: {Filters}:  {Stage} - Select anything that is live on the stage and meets the conditions below.  {Editor} -Select anything that is in the Editor and meets the conditions below.  {Master Controller} (Playback) - Selects only fixtures on the Master Controller that meet the conditions. {Conditions}:  {All Fixtures} - Selects all fixtures that have any changes via the editor.  {Active} - fixture has intensity value over zero.  {Invisible} - recorded hard parameter values for fixtures that do NOT have an intensity value over zero.  {Inactive} (fixtures that have NO recorded values). {Parameter Selection}:  {All for Selected} Grabs all parameters for selected fixtures (shortcut is [VIBE]+GRAB)  {Active (ENTER)} Select all Active fixtures and enters them into the Editor. (Shortcut is GRAB + [ENTER])  {Search &amp; Replace}. [SET] GRAB selects all active fixtures filtered by set (Fixture/Channel/Spot/Matrix/Server/Custom) To Selectively Grab a Controller: Press GRAB - Grab Options pop-up will open Press any Slider/Qkey/Aux Qkey controller button - All fixtures that are in the Controllers active cue and have dimmer levels above Zero (or meet the Grab conditions selected in the pop-up), will be selected. Pressing ENTER will put the selection in the EDITOR. Grab Fixtures in a cue based on a {Library} SK selection: Press GRAB tap a {Library} SK - All fixtures with matching libraries will be selected Tap another {Library} SK - The Library will be swapped to the new library This is especially useful for quickly swapping colors in cues containing libraries Select all parameters for a fixture selection: Select the fixtures Press [VIBE]+GRAB Select all Parameters with hard and tracked values outputting to the stage: Press GRAB [ENTER] 9.3.7 Fixture Selection (Detailed) FIn this guide, FIXTURE will be the default SET but any SET (Channel, Spot, Matrix, Server, User) should also be applicable. Default SET is changed by double pressing the appropriate SET key Dimmer is implied, but parameter would normally be specified after [+ -] and before value. [CE] will backspace the command line one character at a time. If more than one state is involved, the state will backspace right up until the idle state. [Shift CE] will clear the command line to the beginning and put the system in an idle state. [Fixture] # [+  -] [[Full]/[Zero] (@100 and @00 are valid if % or text display format). - [Fixture] # [+  -] [@] enter value. Two digits are required to complete value entry. - [Fixture] # [+  -] [@] [@] will set values to Full. - [Fixture] # [+  -] [@] single value, [ENTER]. E.g. [Fixture] [16] [@] [5] [ENTER] will set a value of 50%. [@] [7] [ENTER] would set a value of 70%. - Pressing [ENTER] at the end of value input is optional and does not affect the sequence. In most cases, it will simply terminate the command line. - [Fixture] # will jump the **live display** screen to the specified fixture if the fixture is not visible on the screen. (Fixture Jumping must be enabled in the **Live Display, {Tools}** (Wrench icon)Pop-up under the **Behavior** Tab - [Fixture] # [+  -] [@] [+] [value] or [@] [-] [value] will make a relative change to the stage value. E.g. {If the stage value is 50, @ + 10 will set the value to 60. @ - 30 would set the value to 20}. The rules for single digit plus Enter will also apply. - [Fixture] # [] #, Parameter, [@] {value] [] [value] will **fan** the range. (if no parameter is specified, dimmer/intensity will be fanned) 0, and 100% are also valid as well as [Zero] and [Full]. - [Fixture] # [] # Parameter, [@] [value] [][] [value] will **mirror** fan the range. {1100 would produce 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0} - Fixture **Dot** = Restore last. Will have a toolbar equivalent. - Fixture  = Reeelect Editor. Will have a toolbar equivalent. - Fixtures and Parameters may be deselected using [RELEASE/DE SEL] Key. This leaves values in the editor but not under the control of the wheels. - [GROUP] # selects all fixtures that are recorded into the group. *The typed fixture order is preserved in a recorded group. - With groups, parameters may be fanned via syntax as above, but their recorded order will be considered. - Control without having to press Shift, Reset, which clears the values in the Editor. - **{LIBRARY}, {LIBRARY}**, will select and enter values from a library into the Editor. This is especially useful when using position libraries as groups with positions. 9.3.8 Setting Parameters using Main Encoder Wheels Vibe features the Smart Window to simplify programming. Programming may also be done traditionally using {Bank} keys and the 4 large push wheels: Using parameter wheels: Fixture # [+  -] Tap {Parameter Bank} on the Smart Screen. If the required parameter is not shown on the encoder wheel display, tap the {parameter Bank} to scroll through all available parameter pages. Turn the encoder wheel of the desired parameter to adjust values. Parameters other than dimmer do not use the @ key.. Direct entry of absolute values: Fixture # [+  -] Tap {Parameter Bank} on Smart Screen. Tap the {Wheel Display} directly above the physical parameter wheel you wish to enter a value for. The wheel display turns red. Enter a value using the keypad. Direct entry of values using push wheels: Fixture # [+  -], Tap {Parameter Bank} on Smart Screen. Press physical wheel - Wheel display over the physical wheel turns red. Enter value via keypad. 9.3.9 Setting Parameters using Interactive Encoder Wheels Vibe has 4 additional interactive push encoder wheels along the right hand side of the smart screen. The parameters assigned to the wheels are dependent on the bank and selected fixture type: E.g: Image assigns Focus and Zoom to the interactive wheels Color Mix assigns Color Wheel 1+2 to the interactive wheels Beam assigns Prism and Prism Rotate to the interactive wheels Shape assigns Focus and Zoom to the interactive wheels In future releases it will be possible for users to customize the defaults. 9.3.10 Release and Home Sequences Release - Removes fixtures or fixture parameter values from the editor Release all active fixtures: Press {RELEASE] key Release fixtures: Fixture # [+  -] [RELEASE] Release a parameter: Fixture # [+  -] tap {Bank} select {Parameter}, [RELEASE] Release a Parameter Bank: Fixture # [+  -] [VIBE] {Bank} [RELEASE] If a fixture is selected and then is made active (Red), the first press of release, releases the parameter and then the second press releases the whole fixture. All devices are assigned home values for parameters based on the manufacturers DMX chart. By default, these home values are used to tell the system where fixture parameters should be when they are not in use. Vibe has two options for home values. They can be set in the System Settings pop-up in the {Editing Properties} tab under the Default Stage Values header. System settings is accessed via the Vibe Menu or by tapping on the {*****} icon in the lower right corner of the main monitor controller display. 9.4 Groups The order that fixtures are typed is stored with a group. Storing Groups to SKs: [FIXTURE] [#] [+  -] [STORE] tap desired {Group Softkey} - it does not matter if levels are set, they will be ignored. Labelling SK Groups: Directly after storing a group, while the focus is still on the group SK, start typing from the keyboard and a Text Entry pop-up will open. At any time, pressing the [TEXT] key followed by tapping the SK will open the Text Entry pop-up. Storing Groups via keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] [+  -] [#] [GROUP] [#] [STORE]. Pressing the [TEXT] key after any Group store will open the Text Entry popup. Modify Groups using Group Settings pop-up: Using keypad - press [GROUP] [#] [Settings] - the Group Settings pop-up will open. Range text labelling may be done via this method. Using SKs - Tap the source {GROUP} SK and then press [Settings] key Group Settings Pop-up A new Group may be created from existing Groups by selecting multiple Groups using Group SKs or via keypad. Press [STORE] then tap destination {Group} SK or Press [Group] [#] [STORE] to create the new Group. The new Group will not be linked to the original Groups Groups may be used to release fixtures: With keypad - [GROUP] [#] [RELEASE] (Currently only works if ENTER is pressed after group selection) With SKs, {Group #}, [Release] Release a fixture from a Group Method 1: With softkeys: Fixture # [+  -], [STORE], tap {Group SK}, Group Efietel pop-up appears, select {Release} With keypad: Fixture # [+  -], press [GROUP], #, [STORE], Group Efietel pop-up, appears, select {Release} Release a fixture from a Group Method 2: [GROUP [#] [EDIT] - [UPDATE] key flashes red ([EDIT] tap {GROUP SK} is also valid) [FIXTURE] [#] [RELEASE] Press [UPDATE] to complete the sequence To Delete a Group: [GROUP] # [DELETE] Tap {GROUP} [#] [DELETE] "],["programming-cues-and-scenes.html", "Chapter 10 Programming Cues, and Scenes 10.1 What Are Qlists, Cues, Scenes, and Submasters? 10.2 Tracking Principals 10.3 Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers 10.4 Master Controller 10.5 Storing Cues to the Master Controller 10.6 Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller 10.7 Cue Store Options 10.8 Assigning Text Labels 10.9 Modifying Cues and Scenes 10.10 Creating New Cues from Existing Cue Data 10.11 Cue Time Properties 10.12 Additional Cue Properties 10.13 Parameter Time 10.14 Group Submasters", " Chapter 10 Programming Cues, and Scenes The following is covered in this chapter: 10.1.

Assign a Group Submaster using existing Groups 10.1 What Are Qlists, Cues, Scenes, and Submasters? Qlists: Qlists are containers that hold cues. They might metaphorically be thought of as file folders. Each Qlist has its own unique Cue numbering system. Qlists currently may contain up to 8,000 cues. Qlists containing Cues must be assigned to Controllers before they can be output to the stage. Cues: Cues are stored containers of editor values. They might metaphorically be thought of as files or records. Cue may only exist within Qlists. Cues may be numbered from 0.001  999.999 Cues cannot be stored without a Qlist destination. Cues may be assigned:  In Time  Out Time  Delay In Time  Delay Out Time  Text Label Scenes: Scenes are essentially a QList and a Cue combined. Scenes may only contain a single Look of editor values. Scenes assigned to Slider Controllers are given the default settings of:  {GO + Jump Parameters}  {Release At Bottom} Scenes may only be assigned In-TIme. Scenes may be given Text Labels 10.2 Tracking Principals Vibe uses the Tracking/Move Fade philosophy common in most current lighting consoles. In tracking consoles, Hard Values (parameter values with stored information) track forward from cue to cue until new hard values are encountered. If we think of cues and values as a spreadsheet, basic tracking systems have two kinds of parameter value cells: Hard Value Cells Tracking Cells get their values by seeing above to the original hard values. They are basically transparent and only hard values are stored for a Cue. This is more efficient. Storing Cue information on a cell basis has other advantages: Each parameter cell can have its own individual time which overrides overall cue time. This allows, for example, Pan/Tilt to have a separate transition time or Color Wheels to snap to their values instead of using overall cue time. As Vibes default behaviour for parameters it LTP (The last action takes precedent), a cell assigned its own time will continue to run its time until either the stored time runs out or it encounters a new hard value. Some traditional theatre consoles call Hard Values Move Instructions and cells that are in transition, Move Fades. Another advantage of tracking is that if you have values that are tracking through a number of cues, all you have to do is change the original hard values and that information will change down to the next hard value. You do not have to copy the change to each cue. An issue with tracking is that making a modification to values in one of the cues in the tracked range will change the values in all the cues following it. To solve this problem, Vibe offers two options: Qonly {Qonly} - Used in any case where cue modification, cue insertion, or cue deletion must affect This Cue Only. The look of the cue following any of the above operations will maintain the appearance it had before the operation. This is done by automatically copying the hard values that made up the original look (stage state) and pasting them into the cue following the modification. The downside is that there is no longer a tracking link from the original hard values even though the values match the original values. Skip Track {Skip} - Stores modified values as a special kind of cell that acts like a normal Tracking Cell until the Skip Cell is reached. The Skip Cell then behaves as if it has hard values and outputs its value to the stage. When the Qlist is advanced past a cue with the Skip Cells, they again behave as tracking cells, thus restoring the link to the original hard values. Storing a Cue modification using Skip, has the same apparent result as storing Qonly. The main difference is that with Qonly, the link to the original hard values is lost, and with Skip, the link is preserved. To make it easier for users to identify cues with Skip Cells, the parameter value with the Skip will be displayed in Magenta. Tracking examples: 10.3 Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers Cues and Scenes may be stored: Directly to the Master Controller using command line syntax. Directly to a specified Qlist and Cue using syntax. Directly to a controller. To store the first cue directly to a controller: Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [HERE] (to any of the buttons of a controller). The first available Qlist will be assigned to the controller and Cue 1 will be created. Alternately a Cue # may be specified in advance: [STORE] [CUE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). A Qlist # may also be specified in advance: [STORE] [QLIST] [3] [CUE] [1] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). To append additional cues to a controller: Set parameter values in the Editor then press the [STORE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of a controller that already has cues stored on it). A cue will be appended to the first available whole number of the Qlist To Store a Scene to a controller: Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [SCENE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). The first available Scene # will be assigned to the controller. No Qlist will be assigned. Alternately a Scene # may be specified in advance. [STORE] [SCENE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). To convert a Scene to a Qlist: Press [STORE] [HERE] to an existing Scene. The Store to Controller pop-up will appear. Tap {Create a new Qlist} the Scene will be assigned the first available Qlist with the Scenes look being converted to Cue 1. 10.4 Master Controller In Vibe, at least one controller must be assigned as the [SELECT] controller. This controller will now be linked to the Master Controller. The Master Controller has 4 large buttons associated with it: [GO] - Initiates a forward timed fade between cues in the selected Qlist. [BACK] - Backs up one cue at a time using system timing properties Back Time. [HOLD] - Pauses the progress of a fade [GOTO] - Advances to the specified cue in system timing properties GOTO Time.  Associated with but not limited to the controller assigned as the [SELECT] Controller are the following 3 buttons: [Load] - Preloads a controller with a specified cue # but does not advance to the cue. Pressing [GO] will advance to the preloaded cue using cue time. [Release] - Releases the destination controller from affecting the stage (Turns it off). [Free] - Unloads the controller. [Load] [Release] and [Free] do not work with the big Master Controller buttons, only with any button on the controller that is associated with it as the [SELECT] controller. By default cues that do not have a Qlist or Controller specified in their destination will be stored to the controller selected as the Master Controller. 10.5 Storing Cues to the Master Controller A Qlist must be assigned to the [SELECT] controller before cues can be stored using theatre style keypad syntax A Qlist does not have to contain cues to be assigned to a controller To assign a Qlist to a controller and make it the Master Controller: Press [QLIST] [#] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller) - The Qlist will be assigned to the controller. Press [SELECT] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller) - The destination controller will now be the Master Controller and the [Second Button] of the Selected controller will turn dark blue to indicate that it is now assigned to the Master Controller. The top header of the Controller Display on the main monitor above the controller will also turn dark blue. To Store a cue to the Master Controller: Set Parameter levels in the Editor the press [CUE] [#] [STORE]. The cue will be added to the Master Controllers assigned Qlist. Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001  999.999 Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax or the Direct Store method. Pressing [STORE] [STORE] or [STORE] [ENTER] will store editor values to the next whole number cue at the end of a Qlist. (Next spacing can be customized in system settings). Vibe uses the Clear Editor After Store behaviour common in most theatre consoles. The Controller will by default advance to the stored cue and clear the Editor. This behaviour may be disabled in System Settings. 10.6 Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller 10.6. Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller The destination Qlist must be assigned to a controller in advance or after storing the first Cue, the destination Qlist will bump the current cue on the Master Controller out and replace it.. To store a Cue to a Qlist that is already assigned to a Controller: (Usually not the Master Controller) Press [Qlist] [#] [HERE] to any button of the destination controller. The Qlist will be assigned to the controller Set parameter levels in the Editor 3.Press [Qlist] [#] [CUE] [#] [STORE] Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001  999.999 Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax specifying the Qlist # in advance or 10.3.

Press the [UPDATE] and the Update pop-up will open. Two columns will appear. The left column shows Cues available for updating and the right column shows Libraries available for updating. If affected values are not referencing a library, the Cue column will indicate the source cue that the modifications will be updated to. If the Editor parameter values are new to all active cues, destination cue. Will be dependent on the New Values setting:  If {All Selected Objects} is selected, a list of all possible active cues will appear in the Cue column.  If {Master PB Only} (controller) is selected, new values will be only be updated to the Qlist assigned as Master Controller.  If {Dont Store} is selected, no new parameter values will be updated. Selected cues may be freely deselected in the Update pop-up. Set Tracking Options as required. Set Source Filters as required. Press or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and complete the Update. UPDATE Source Filters: {Master Controller} - Updates will only be made to the active cue on the controller assigned to the Master Controller. {Last Activated Controller} - Updates will be made to the last controller that asserter priority. {Grab All} - All Active Controllers will be shown in a list and the user must select the destination of the updates. UPDATE Tracking Options: {Default (Track)} - Changes will track forward to the next cue if it does not have a hard value. {Cue Only} - Changes will be made to This Cue Only preserving the look of the next cue (Hard values will be added to next cue). {Skip Cue} - Changes will be made to the current cue but the changes will be skipped over preserving the link to the original hard values. {Back Track} - Updates the changes to the original hard value that made the stage look. Update directly to a Controller: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Press [UPDATE] - The Update pop-up will open. Make option changes if needed. Press [HERE] to any button on a destination Controller - the Editor values will be updated into the active cue on the destination Controller.

Alternate method: Select the source [CUE] [#] and tap {Link} on the Editor Toolbar, the Link pop-up will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the link. If the source cue is forgotten, check the Link # field in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet. 10.12.2 Loop 10.12.2. Loop In many consoles, the only way to create a loop is to create a link from the end of a range of cues back to the beginning. Follow time must then be assigned to all of the cues. In Vibe this is also possible but a shorter more efficient method is also provided. LOOP is a function similar to LINK. It is assigned in the Loop pop-up or via the Cue Settings pop-up. Loop Pop-up To assign a Loop: Using keypad and Editor Toolbar: Start [CUE] [#] tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop pop-up will appear. Type end [#] or use {To Cue No} field list to select the end cue. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Using Cue Setting Pop-Up: Start [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - Cue Settings pop-up will open. Tap {Loop} - Loop pop-up will appear. Type end Cue [3] or scroll the value picker to the desired end cue [#]. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Press Enter or again to close the Settings pop-up. Direct via the cue sheet: Tap in the Loop # field of the start cue in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet - The Loop pop-up will appear. Type, scroll or drag to the desired end cue. Press Enter or to complete the operation. To assign a Loop Count - A Loop Count may be assigned using any of the above methods to open the Loop pop-up. Make sure {Auto Loop} is selected. Under the {# Of Time To Loop} field, Type loop count number, or scroll the value picker to the desired loop count number. Press Enter or to complete the operation. To enable {Auto Follow} - Auto Follow loops advance to the cue following the loop, after completion of the loop count. Toggle {Auto Follow} - On/Off as required. To set a Loop as Manual Loop (Does not advance automatically) Toggle {Auto Loop} - Off To remove a Loop: (Qlist must be released first) Select the start cue and open the Loop pop-up by any of the above methods. If the proper start cue has been selected, the {Unloop} key will appear. Tap the {Unloop} key to remove the Link. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Alternate method: (Qlist must be released first) Select the start {CUE] [#] and tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop pop-up will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the loop. 10.12.3 Tracking Options Individual cues may be tagged with one of four Tracking Options: Cue Only - Removes tracked values from asserting to the stage and sets them at home values (Not to be confused with Cue Only when used with {UPDATE} which works a cell basis). Skip Cue - All cells in the cue will behave like Skip Cells. Values will still skip around a Skip Cue, even if the values in the Skip Cue are modified. Block Cue - All cue parameter values whether tracked or hard will be made to act like hard values. Any new values added to cues above the Blocked cue will not track past a cue tagged a Block. Track - The systems default behaviour. There are two additional properties a cue can be tagged with: Force Black - When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first forced to Black Out, parameters then move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. Look Ahead cue - When Look Ahead is disabled for a Qlist, Individual cues with dark values may be tagged to perform Look Ahead prepositioning.. 10.13 Parameter Time Parameter Time: 10.13.1.

"],["libraries.html", "Chapter 12 Libraries 12.1 What are Libraries 12.2 Store and Modify Bank Libraries 12.3 Object Libraries", " Chapter 12 Libraries The following is covered in this chapter: 12.1. What are Libraries 12.2. Store and Modify Bank Libraries 12.3. Object Libraries 12.1 What are Libraries Vibe has two types of Libraries, Bank Libraries and Object Libraries: Bank Libraries - Store commonly used parameter values for Intensity, Position, Color, Beam, Image, Shapers, and Video content. They correspond to the parameter banks. Libraries are essentially filtered cues that are referenced by recorded objects such as Scenes and Cues. There are also two special bank libraries, Custom, and Effects. Custom libraries are unfiltered and record whatever parameters are in the Editor. The system FILTERS key function or user defined Filter object libraries may be used to limit which parameters are stored in Custom libraries. Effect libraries store effects parameters from the Editor so that they do not have to be manually rebuilt every time they are required. Object Libraries - Pools of system object types. Common Object Libraries are:  Group  Qlist  Scenes Single non-Qliet Looks(Submasters on some consoles)  Snaps  Snapshot controller states. Sometimes referred to as Snap Shots  Filters  Pool of user defined flters  Macro Scenes are like Submasters or Group Masters on other consoles. They may be set as additive or subtractive. 12.2 Store and Modify Bank Libraries 12.2. Store and Modify Bank Libraries Compulite Libraries are similar to Presets or Palettes on other consoles. Automatic Parameter Grouping: Vibe uses tee concept of Auto Parameter Grouping parameters when storing libraries. All parameters in Position, Color, and Shaper parameter banks will always be recorded into a library to guarantee that what was viewed on the stage is the same as what is recorded in the library. Filters may be applied to modify what is stored in a Library. Libraries can be assigned one of six behaviours: Fixture Specific  Values only applied only to specific stored fixtures. Parameter Specific  Values will be applied to all matching parameter types. Pattern Values will be applied to all matching parameter types and will keep the pattern of the values. Device + Fixture  the first fixture will be used as a reference for all other similar fixture types. If values are changed for specific fixtures they will be stored in the library as if they were fixture specific. If a fixture other than the first fixture is released from the library, its values will again be referenced from the first fixture. If the first fixture is released, the next fixture will become the reference. Device and Parameter  Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device type and the same parameter type. Device and pattern  Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device type and keep the pattern of values. Library Bank SKs have default filters and behaviours based on the way they are commonly used. Store a Library using keypad syntax: 1. Press [Fixture] [#] [+ à -] - Select parameter {Bank } on Smart Screen. Use Smart Screen pickers, and/or adjust parameter wheels, or type value to set values. Press [LIBRARY] - Library {Store Options} pop-up will open at the bottom of the Smart Screen and {Banks} will appear on the Editor Toolbar. Tap a parameter {Bank} key on the Editor Toolbar. Enter the destination library number via the keypad. Make {Library Store Options} changes as required. Press [STORE] to complete the sequence. A shortcut for Bank selection is to specify a number directly after pressing [LIBRARY] key: 1 = Intensity bank 2 = Position bank 3 = Color bank 4 = Beam bank 5 = Image 6 = Shape 7 = Custom 8 = Effect After typing the first number, the bank name will appear on the command line. The next number typed will be the library number. Modify a Library using [UPDATE]: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage from a library referenced in an active cue or scene. Press the [UPDATE] - The Update pop-up will open. Two columns will appear. The left column shows Cues available for updating and the right column shows Libraries available for updating. The source library or libraries should be selected. Selected libraries may be freely deselected in the Update pop-up. If all Libraries are deselected, updates will become hard values in the source cue instead of the source libraries being updated. Press or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and complete the update. Update pop-up Overwrite, Update, or Release fixtures in Libraries via Softkey syntax: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage from a library referenced in an active cue or scene. Press [STORE] and tap source {Library SK}. The {Cancel, Update, Overwrite, Release} pop-up will appear on the large screen. Tap {Overwrite} to replace all fixtures with those in the Editor, {Update} to merge the editor into the library, or {Release} to remove the selected fixtures from the Library. Releasing fixtures is only valid if the library is Fixture Specific or Device + Fixture in the case where specific fixtures have modified recorded values. Alternately the sequence [LIBRARY] {Bank} from the Editor Toolbar [#] [STORE] to an existing library will work the same as above. Object Exists pop-up Library Settings pop-up Library Settings may be changed at any time after they are created using the Library Settings pop-up. There are two ways to do this: Tap the Library {SK} you wish to modify and press [SETTINGS]. (This is invalid with Snaps and Macros as it will trigger them) Or Press [Library] tap {Bank} on the Editor Toolbar Press [#] [SETTINGS] - The Settings pop-up will also open.  If Reference is selected, modifying the library will modify the values of ALL cues that reference it.  If Timing is selected, any parameter cell times in the Editor will be stored with the library. Text labels may be assigned at any time there is NOT an active selection in the Editor. Any of the following methods are valid: For Library Softkeys, Tap a Library {SK} - Start typing on the pull-out keyboard. The Text Entry pop-up will appear. Tap a Library {SK} press [TEXT] - The Text Entry pop-up will appear. Press [TEXT] tap a Library {SK} - The Text Entry pop-up will appear.

Building Effects Using the Advanced Effects Editor 13.1 Effect Basics 13.1. Effect Basics All Screen captures below are from the Advanced Effects Editor. Vibe Effects are made up of Effect Events running along horizontal Effect Tracks. Each Event Track must have: At least one parameter assigned in the far left column. Additional parameters may be added but they will respond simultaneously to the Effect. One Effect Event. Additional Effect Events may be added to the track each with its own time base or Effects may be merged and share a time base. Multi-track effects: Effects requiring more than one parameter may be stacked on separate Effects Tracks. Examples of Multi-track effects would be:  CMY and RGB color effects  Pan/Tilt Circles  Blade effects All Effect Events are built from the following components: Functions Primitives Patterns Functions: Are the basic building blocks of effects. They may be assigned to Primitives and Patterns. Vibe uses functions as the raw building blocks for three features of the console: Primitives - Main element of Effects Profiles - Used for cue transitions Curves - Used for dimmer behavior Vibe ships with a number of read only Functions. They may not be edited. Users may create their own functions in the Advanced Effects Function Editor. Primitives: When Functions are linked to parameters on an Effect Track, the are called Primitives. Primitives modulate parameter values based on their assigned Functions. Primitives may be modified by a number of Primitive settings. Primitive Settings: Time - The duration of time it takes each fixture to complete one cycle across the Primitive. Size - The amplitude of the Primitives function. Base - The Y axis of start of the Primitives function when each fixture crosses it. In Base - Adjusts the direction from the parameters start point (Base) it is linked to the Swing {Up} [Center} {Down} keys. E.g. If the Base value of tilt is 50% (0°) and the In Base is Center (-50%), tilt would split center with a sine wave primitive assigned to it. Up (0%) would send the tilt from strait down to full out into the audience. Down (-100%) would send the tilt from strait down to full up upstage. Pattern: Sets the behavior of fixture selection as it transitions across the Primitive. Pattern Settings: Spread (Offset) - Sets the percentage of offset between each fixture in a selection. 100% would evenly divide up the selections transition across the Primitive. A Spread of 0% would have all fixtures transitioning across the Primitive in unison. UP - Based on the UP group #, Each UP grouping will complete a full cycle across the primitive before the next UP group can start. e.g. A selection of 8 fixtures assigned to a primitive with a sine wave function and a spread of 100%, UP is set to 1, Fixture 1 will have to complete its full cycle across the Primitive before fixture 2 will begin. If the UP # is set to 2 fixture 1 and 2 will have split the cycle before the next two fixtures start. Effects: The combination of Parameters, Primitives, and Patterns. Effects Settings: Settings that affect both Primitives and Patterns (Effect Event) are called Effect settings. Effect setting are integrated into the Smart Screen Editor and are available by tapping the empty space beside the Effect Event in the Advanced Editor. Offset All - Moves the start time of the Effect Event along the X axis of the Effect Track. Params Spread - Is a toggle button that enables the proportional offsetting of the start times of multiple Effect Tracks at the same time. {Params Spread} is a quick way to make CMY or RGB effects where colors need to spread apart so as not to mix to black or white. Effects Libraries: Once effects have been created then may be directly stored in cues and scenes or saved in Effects Libraries for future use. Effect Libraries are stored similar to normal Libraries Store and Modify Bank Libraries. Effects libraries have one additional option to allow users to include the base values. This is useful when effects must start from an absolute value. 13.2 Smart Screen Effects Editor 13.2. Smart Screen Effects Editor The Smart Screen Effects Editor allows users to quickly build effects within the normal work flow of the console while still having access to the main live displays. Effect Tracks are created for every selected parameter but they are hidden to remove screen clutter. Some advance operations are removed to speed up programming of simple effects. Two pages are available in the Smart Screen Editor: Attributes - Used for building Effect Events. Grouping - Used for setting fixture Blocks Of (Fixture Grouping in Vector) and Sub Blocks Of (Blocks on some console). Smart Screen Attribute page 13.2.1 Building Effects Using the Small Screen Editor 13.2.1. Building Effects Using the Small Screen Editor To build an Effect in the Smart Screen Effects Editor: Select the the fixtures to be used in the Effect. Select the parameter/parameters to be in the Effect 9.4.2. What are Parameters Press [EFFECT] - The Smart Screen Effect Editor will open in the {Attributes} display with a blank Effect Event. Tap the Pre Built tab and make a selection. Or Tap the Favorite Primitive tab and select a Primitive - the Function shown on the Primitive will be loaded with a default linear Pattern. The Pattern may be changed by by tapping any of the following:  / Fixtures move in a positive direction across the selection.   Fixture move in a negative direction across the selection.  / Fixture mirror in a positive direction.  / Fixture mirror in a negative direction. Set the Offset {Pattern Spread} - Default is 100%.  100% = Selection is divided 100% transitioning across the Primitive.  0% = all fixtures transition in unison. Set Swing (In Base) as needed 13.1. Effects Basics Adjust Size and Base to set the Low and High ranges of the values Set the Rate - x.xx Rate is a multiplier of the time value. Default Effect Time is 4 seconds to complete the cycle Similar results to inverting the pattern functions may be achieved by reversing the selection direction with the { Negative}, {Positive } keys Smart Screen Grouping: For Grouping to be noticeable there must be an Pattern Offset Spread above 0%. Tap the {Grouping} key - The Grouping page will open. If the Offset Pattern Spread is not above 0%, tap the {Wave On} key. The Spread will be changes to 100%. Set the {Blocks Of} [#] - This interleaves the Pattern into Groupings.  The Default for Blocks and Sub Block is 1/0 - No Groupings.  When {Blocks Of} is set to 1 or above, the Sub Blocks will move to 1 and Interleave Groups will be possible.  e.g. 2/1 would interleave a selection into Odds/Evens.  e.g. 3/1 would interleave a selection of 12 fixtures into [1+4+7+10] - [2+5+8+11] - [3+6+9+12] Set the {Sub Blocks Of} - Combines fixture in a selection, to act like single fixtures.  e.g. 12/2 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12] As a shortcut, Setting {Sub Block Of} back to 0 allows {Blocks Of} to combine fixtures instead of interleaving - 2/0 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12] The Advanced Effects Editor may be opened at any time by pressing [Vibe] Effects. All Effects running in the Smart Screen Effects Editor will be synchronized with the Advanced Editor After programming an Effect, Close the editor using the in the upper right corner. 13.3 Advanced Effects Editor Both Effect Editors write to the same Effect Engine. Either or both may be used to create effects. Whichever is opened at the time will be synchronized to the Effects Engine, but only one Effect Editor may open at a time. Selecting multiple columns and rows: It is possible to make simultaneous changes to Primitive, Pattern, and Effect settings by toggling them on/off. Advanced Effect Editor The Advanced Effects Editor differs from the Smart Screen Effects Editor in the following ways: Parameter selection is made in the Effects Editor not before entering it. Effect Tracks are shown. Multiple Parameters may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Multiple Effects Events may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Effect sharing the same Effect Track can uses separate patterns or share patterns. Pattern Size, Rate, and Base may be spread to create randomized looking effects. Repeat - The number of times each Effect Event repeats before moving on the the next Effects Event, when they are sharing an Effects Track. Building Effects in the Advanced Editor differs from the Smart Screen Editor in that a only a fixture selection is needed before entering the editor. Parameters are selected using the {Filters} and {Choose Parameter} . This takes a bit longer but is more flexible.

The following is covered in this chapter: 14.1. Controller Priority Logic 14.2. Controller Overview 14.3. Master Controller 14.4. GOTO and LOAD 14.5. Configuring Controllers 14.6. Controller Color Codes 14.7. Working With controllers 14.8. Controller Release and Free 14.9. Controller Qlist Properties 14.10. Controller Modes 14.11. Rate and Teach Keys 14.1 Controller Priority Logic Controller Priority: Vibe keeps an LTP priority list of which controllers own parameters and the order in which they were asserted. Every time a controller is turned on, its parameters are asserted and the controller moves to the top of the list. Parameters that are still on active controllers but are currently overridden are said to be robbed. When the controller that owns the parameter is released from the stage, the last active controller to own the robbed parameter is now moved back to the top of the list and reasserted the parameter to the stage. This feature is very useful for On the Fly programming where a main Qlist may be temporarily overridden by Qkeys or Controllers and quickly restored when they are released. The Editor is always the highest propriety and will override any values from controllers until they are released or The Editor is reset. Priority Groups: Controllers assigned the same Priority Group number will be LTP amongst themselves. Controllers assigned higher Propriety Group numbers cannot be overridden (robbed) by controllers with lower numbers. Assigning Controllers to priority Groups: 1. Tap the top area of a controller display, the Settings pop-up will open. 2. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. OR Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button, the Settings pop-up will open. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. Rotate the virtual wheel to the desired Priority Group number or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and type a Priority Group number from 0 - 999. 14.2 Controller Overview Controllers are used to playback or execute a number of objects: Cues Scenes Group Submasters Libraries Macros Snaps Vibe has five controller types: Three button Motorized Slider Controllers Single button Qkey Controllers Single Auxiliary Qkey Controllers Non-Motorized Global Slider Controllers A/B theatre style A/B dipless crossfader pair Vibe software makes no distinction between physical and virtual controllers. This allows the system hardware to be scaled. Below is a list of total quantities of physical and virtual controllers that are supported. Controller quantities and numbering: Physical and Virtual 30 pages of 100 Motorized Sliders - Numbered 1.1  30.100 30 pages of 100 Qkeys - Numbered 1.101  30.200 30 pages of 100 Auxiliary Qkeys - Numbered 1.201  30.300 100 Non-motorized Global Sliders - Numbered 301  400 1 Non-motorized A/B dipless crossfader - Numbered 401 Controllers are numbered from right to left to facilitate continuous numbering with physical and virtual controller wings. Compound Controllers: Controllers may be extended in width to make larger compound controllers. This is useful in creating additional crossfader pairs or adding controls for rate and effects. There is no limit as to how wide a controller may be, but for practical purposes, a limit of 6 wide is suggested. A/B Cross Faders: An A/B Cross Fader Pair is provided for manual Theater Style playback of cues. By default, the fader on the left will control dimmer parameters fading in. By default, the fader on the right will control all other values including the dimmer that is fading out. Parameter values that match will not dip even if the A and B are at different levels. 14.3 Master Controller Master Controller: Any single Controller may be linked to the Master Controller by Pressing [SELECT] [HERE] to any of the buttons of the controller. [GO] - Initiates a forward transition from one cue to another using Cue Time. [BACK] - Initiates a transition to the previous cue using system Default Back Time. [HOLD] - Pauses a cue in transition. Pressing [HOLD] again resumes the transition. Pressing [GO] will resume the transition as well. Pressing [BACK] will fade to the previous cue. The A/B is only linked to the Master Controller if the [SELECT] is assigned to A/B.. 14.4 GOTO and LOAD GOTO and LOAD are used to crossfade to cues out of sequence. By default, GOTO immediately transitions to the specified cue in the system GOTO Time. LOAD preloads controllers. The next [GO] will transition to the preloaded cue in Cue Time. GOTO Commands: GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system GOTO Time: [CUE] [#] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using a specified Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] - Enter time value [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system Cue Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using Goto Cue pop-up: Press [GOTO] - Goto Cue pop-up will open. Select {Qlist} if not the current Qlist on the Master Controller. Select the {Cue}. Select behaviour. {Default GOTO time} - Uses system default GOTO Time. {Cue Time} - Uses Cues recorded time. {Custom} - Set GOTO time using the Custom Time wheel or tap centre of the wheel until it turns red and set time value from the keypad. {Release Master PB on Top} - Releases the Master Controller. Press the or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and execute the GOTO. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one.. GOTO a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [GO] (Controller must have a GO button assigned). GOTO Cue Zero - Cue Zero is essential {Release Master PB to Top}. [CUE] [0] [GOTO] It is also possible to go out of sequence directly to a Cue on the Master Controller (in cue time): [CUE] [#] [GO] Load Commands: Load a cue on the Master Controller - Method 1. [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - To Controller assigned as [SELECT] Press [GO] - On Controller assigned as [SELECT] Load a cue on the Master Controller - Method 2. [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [LOAD] Press [GO] - Using Master Controller GO or GO of controller assigned as [SELECT] LOAD a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - Qlist and Cue will be preloaded. Press [GO] - Controller will execute loaded cue. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Controller is specified, that Qlist will replace the current one with the specified cue pending. 14.5 Configuring Controllers Controller buttons and sliders may be customized to allow maximum flexibility. When Qlists and Scenes are initially assigned to Controllers, the buttons are configured as per the System Settings defaults for Controller and Controller Action. Defaults are accessed by tapping the System Status area at the far right side of the controller display.   Assigning Buttons and Slider Behavior: Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any button of the controller that has an object assigned to it - The Slider Definitions pop-up will appear with the {Controller Definitions} tab selected. Alternatively, tap any of the controller {function labels} on the controller display on the monitor above the Scene Slider If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one.. Tap one of the three assignable {Buttons} or the {Slider} button in the centre - A context sensitive drop down menu based on the object assigned and the specific button selected will appear. Choose a Control behaviour from the menu. Assignable Button Assignable Button Behavior: Assignable Slider Behavior: Default settings for controllers assigned Qlists, Scenes, and Submasters may be set in the Defaults section of the System Settings Pop-up. See 7.5.1. Controller Settings 14.6 Controller Color Codes Controller Live Display color coding If [SELECT] Master Controller: If from a non-[Select] Controller: Controller Display and Backlit Controller Keys color coding: 14.7 Working With controllers Controller types: Detailed Control Keys: Provide On the Fly access to button functions not directly assigned to controllers. Apply a Controller Key: Press a {Control Key} Press any destination [Controller Button] to apply the Control Keys function In most cases, a double press of the Control Keys locks them on until pressed again. Control Key Functions: FLASH - Momentarily turns on a Controller.  Most useful when locked on with double press. SOLO - Turns off intensity parameters on all controllers excluding the destination controller. GO/RELEASE - First press initiates a GO, second press initiates a RELEASE.  Most useful when locked on with double press. ON - Instantly turns on a controller. OFF - Instantly turns off a controller. Latch - Currently unimplemented. GO - Initiates a GO command. ASSERT - Takes back control of parameters that have been robbed by other controllers. HOLD/BACK - If a controller is running, pause the controller. If a controller is static, initiate a BACK command. &lt;&lt;&lt; (Step Back) - Steps backwards through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [BACK] will also step backwards through the list. &gt;&gt;&gt; (Step Forward) - Steps forward through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [GO] will also step forward through the list. &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Reverses sequence direction (mainly used with loops and chasers). Assign a Qlist to a Controller: [QLIST] [#] [HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the start point of the range. Blank Qlists may be assigned to any controller. Assign a range of Qlist: [QLIST] [#]  [QLIST] [#] [HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the start point of the range. Assign a Cue to a controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [HERE] Press any of the controllers buttons - The Qlist and Cue will be assigned to the Controller and default controller configuration and settings will be applied. See: 7.5.2. Controller Actions Release and unload Controllers: See: 14.8. Controller Release and Free 14.8 Controller Release and Free Vibe has two types of release functions, Editor Release and Controller Release. The following deals with Controller Release. Off - Instantly turns off a controller [OFF] [HERE] to any controller button. Release - Turns off a controller using release time. [RELEASE] [HERE] to any controller button. Release All - Turns off all controllers using release time. [VIBE] + [RELEASE] Release Time - By default controllers use the Default Release Time set in System Settings Timing. See: 7.2. Timing Release time may also be set on a Qlist basis using the Qlist Properties Pop-up. See: 7.5.3. Qlist Properties Free - Unloads a controller. It does not delete the loaded object. [FREE] [HERE] to any controller button. Free All - Unloads all controllers. [VIBE] + [FREE] 14.9 Controller Qlist Properties By default, the first incident of a Qlist being assigned to a controller will take its Qlist properties from the user default Qlist Properties. For Qlist Properties details, see: 7.5.3. Qlist Properties Each new incident of assigning the same Qlist to additional controllers will initially copy the Qlist properties from the first assignment. If changes are made to individual controller Qlist properties, those changes stay with the controller and are not copied or updated to other controller Qlist properties. If it is desirable to update what will be copied to future assignments of the Qlist, toggle {Save to Qlist} On. Changes made to the current Qlist properties will now be passed along. Qlist properties may be restored to their user defaults by tapping the {Restore Defaults} key. 14.10 Controller Modes The Controller Mode keys are located at the far left of the console beside the motorized faders. The motorized faders may be assigned to any one of 4 modes. These modes allow for a quick modification to various rate and effect parameters. Controller modes are outside of the editor and are designed for On the Fly usage. Controller Modes allow the following to be adjusted: [FADERS] - Normal behaviour for the fader as assigned in Controller Definitions [RATE] - The Rate of the fades, loops, effects, and chasers on the controller will be proportionally adjusted. Motorized faders will move to an optimized position of 32% allowing for proportional adjustment of a controllers rate. [SIZE] - Proportionally adjusts the size of effects running on the controller. [OFFSET] - Adjusts the spread of the fixtures in running effects [PROTECT] - When implemented, must be held down before any of the fader modes may be changed. 14.11 Rate and Teach Keys The Rate function allows users to adjust controller rates or effects parameters in real time. This is very helpful in fine tuning chases and effects to synchronize with music, or to improvise performances on the fly. The Rate Screen operates outside of the editor and is non destructive. Changes made in the Rate Screen may not be stored in cues but may be stored and recalled in [Snaps]. Using the Rate Screen: Large encoder wheels: Press the [Rate Key] - When opened, all loaded controllers will appear in the Selected Controllers section of the display. Initially all loaded controllers will be globally affected by the wheels and features in the Rate Screen. Pressing any [Key] of a controller will deselect all other controllers except the controller that was selected. Additional controllers may be toggled on or off as desired and they will appear in the selected Controllers display.  {Select All} will reselect all loaded controllers for rate control.  {Deselect All} will release all selected controllers from rate control  {Show Active} will release all controllers in the Selected Controllers section that are not currently under the control of the rate wheels. Wheel 1 - {Controller Rate} speeds up or slows down the cross fade rate of the controller. This may be used for cue transitions, chases, or effects. Range: 0% (Stopped) &gt; 3000% (effectively cut time) Wheel 2 - {X Fade %} adjusts the fade vs jump percent of a chaser. Range: 0% (full jump) &gt; 100% (full cross fade) Wheel 3 - {Intensity Limit} proportionally limits the intensity output of a controller. Range 0% (no intensity output) &gt; 100% {Intensity controller full} Wheel 4 - {Library Editor Rate} currently unimplemented (adjusts the speed that Libraries are faded into the editor) Small encoder wheels: (top to bottom) Small encoder wheels: (top to bottom) Small Wheel 1 - {FX Rate} adjusts the rate of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 2 - {FX Size} adjusts the size of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 3 - {FX Offset} adjusts the offset (Spread) of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 3 - {FX Base} adjusts the base values (start point) of parameters that are in running effects on the selected controllers. Reset keys: {Reset Ctrl Rate} - Sets all controller rates back to their default of 100% {Reset FX Rate} - Sets controlled FX rates back to their stored values. {Reset FX Size} - Resets controlled size of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Offset} - Resets controlled offsets of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Base} - Resets controlled effects base values back to their stored values.

The following is covered in this chapter: 15.1. Look Ahead (Move in Dark) 15.2. Look Ahead Cue (Mark) 15.3. Force Black 15.1 Look Ahead (Move in Dark) 15.1. Look Ahead (Move in Dark) The Look Ahead feature is used for automatic pre-positioning of selected parameters when the fixtures dimmer is dark, thus avoiding visible p r meter movement. For Look Ahead to work, the fixtures dimmer must be at ZR, and there must be a parameter moves from one cue to the next cue. Look Ahead fades can be set for a specified default time or user time, which is different than the cues default fade time. Before using Look Ahead, you must create a Look Ahead mask. The Look Ahead mask tells Vibe which spots, spot parameters, or scrollers are affected by the Look Ahead feature. If you have not specified parameters in the Look Ahead mask, all parameters will be affected. The Look Ahead mask can contain more than one parameter. Currently, the Look Ahead pre-positioning will happen at the last available opportunity before the dimmer turns on. If in specific cues you want to prevent applying the Look Ahead mask, give dimmers a value of 1%.. LED fixtures without physical dimmer parameters should not be included in the Look Ahead Mask. Enable or Disable Look Ahead on all controllers: Open System Settings from the Vibe Menu or tap the status area of the main monitor - The System Settings pop-up will open. Tap the {Timing} tab to open the Timing Properties pop-up. Under the Look Ahead header enable or disable all controllers using {Set All Controllers ON} or {Set All Controllers OFF}. There is no confirmation of On/Off as these buttons basically toggle {Look Ahead} in all Qlist Properties pop-ups. If Look Ahead is globally turned off it may still be enabled on a per Qlist basis in the Qlist Properties pop-up. Look Ahead status for individual controllers may be viewed in the controllers Qlist Properties. Create the Look Ahead Mask: Select the fixtures to be in the Mask. Optionally select the parameters to be included in the Mask - If no parameters are selected, all parameters will be included. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [STORE]. Delete the Look Ahead Mask: Select the fixtures to be deleted from the Mask. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [DELETE]. A Look Ahead cue is a cue that automatically pre-positions parameters when the dimmer is off. Currently only time can be set for a Look Ahead cue. Set individual Look Ahead Time - Speed at which fixtures move in dark. CUE] [#] [Time] - The Time pop-up will open. Tap {Look Ahead} - The indicator will turn green and Look Ahead will appear over the virtual time wheel. Set the time value using the virtual wheel or type the value directly on the keypad. Press [Enter] or tap to close the pop-up and store the Look Ahead time. Look Ahead time can also be changed using the [CUE ] [#] [SETTINGS] command. Default Look Ahead time can be set in System Settings/Defaults/Cue Settings. Enable or Disable Look Ahead on individual controllers: Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button of the controller you wish to enable or disable Look Ahead on - The Settings pop-up will open. Tap the {Qlist properties} tab - The Qlist Properties pop-up will open. Toggle Look Ahead on or off. Press [Enter] or tap to close the pop-up. 15.2 Look Ahead Cue (Mark) Unimplemented Look Ahead: (sometimes referred to a Mark Cue)  Unlike having Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in Cue Store Options as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just the tagged cue. 15.3 Force Black When it is not desirable to see parameter values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programing time. In a cue flagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first forced to Black Out, parameters them move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. To flag a cue as a Force Black Cue: [QLIST [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS]. Toggle {Force Black} On - The indicator will turn green and the cue will be flagged as a Force Black cue. Press [Enter] or tap to close the pop-up.

This feature is under development and this section is preliminary.. The following is covered in this section: 21.1. Timecode and Timeline basics 21.2. Create a Timeline View 21.3. Configuring Timecode 21.4. Recording Timeline Tracks 21.5. Executing and Editing Events 21.6. Markers 21.1 Timecode and Timeline basics Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. There is no practice limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show but graphic performance may suffer with more than 16 Timeline Tracks. Each timeline may have its own timecode source. Vibe can read the following sources: Virtual Local - Internally generated timecode. Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI timecode received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console. USB MIDI class compliant timecode. MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol. Input sources from remote multi-User consoles and devices Unlike some consoles, Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. There is no need to create event lists. Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks. Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source. Supported frame rates are: 24 FPS 25 FPS 29.97 FPS drop-frame 30 FPS 21.2 Create a Timeline View When starting a new show any Timeline views stored in Layouts will be empty and no timecode devices will be connected to the Timeline View. If no layout contains a Timeline view, a view must be added to a blank page. Virtually unlimited timecode views may be created but they will all be synchronized and show the same tracks and options. Timeline view with two timeline tracks, the cursor, and a marker To add a Timeline view to a page: Tap {Vibe} on the monitor that will display the Timeline - Vibe menu will open. Tap {Pages} - Page display will open. Add a blank page from either the {Programming} or {Playback} work space templates - A blank workspace will open. Tap the Lock/Unlock icon to enable adding a new view. On the screen with the blank workspace, open the {Vibe} menu again and select} {Display Objects}  {Timeline View} - A blank timeline view will appear on the workspace.

Additionally, the following general purpose ports may be used for Timecode: USB 2 and USB 3 ports can be used for USB class compliant MIDI over USB. Compulite devices that support MIDI over Ethernet can also be used. Recommended quality and level for SMPTE: SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended. As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, If long runs are to be used, it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance. 1/O Settings Pop-up in Timecode Tab Enable Timecode: From the patch toolbar tap {I/O Settings} For Tap {General} tab and select:  {Local MIDI} to enable the DIN connector MIDI.  {External MIDI} to enable USB MIDI or MIDI over Ethernet.

Currently, timeline events are recorded in real time and then edited. To create a timeline track: Open a Time Line View. Tap {} - The Create New Timeline pop-up will open. Select a timeline number and name. Choose Start from {Blank} Timeline as an option. Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source.  Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock.  Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console.  Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device. Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button.  Record overwrites existing events.  + Record adds events to existing events. If using internal TC, press Play. If using external TC start the timecode source. The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controllers events. When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.  Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events. 21.5 Executing and Editing Events To Execute timeline events: If the source is external MIDI or SMPTE timecode, press [Play] on the timecode source. The events will synchronize to the source timecode. If the source is internal, tap {Play} on the timecode views control bar. The internal timecode will start and events will execute. The control bar may be used to stop and rewind events when the source is internal Editing timecode events Record may be enabled and disabled on the fly to overwrite sections of a timeline track. Events may also be moved forwards and backward using the Set Delta pop-up in the Actions drop down. 21.6 Markers To aid in timeline navigation, Markers may be inserted.

What is MIDI 22.2. General MIDI Configuration 22.3 Configuring MIDI Notes and Commands 22.4. MIDI Show Control 22.5 MIDI Time Code 22.1 What is MIDI MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that was originally developed by the music industry to allow multiple MIDI sound devices to be triggered from just one source, usually a master keyboard or synthesizer. It is a control protocol and does not transmit audio. Over the years the MIDI protocol has evolved to also be a popular way to synchronize and Play lighting equipment. MIDI is based around a 7-bit architecture and therefore has a theoretical 127 possible notes for a keyboard. (Most pianos use 88 notes and synthesizers use even less) In the basic MIDI implementation it is possible to have: 16 independent MIDI channels - The channels systems listen on. 127 Note ONs - Pressing down on a keyboard. 127 Note OFFs - Lifting off a keyboard. Note On Velocity of 1  127 - How hard the key is struck. After Touch pressure of 0  127 - Ho muce pressure is applied after the key reaches the bottom. 127 controllers each with a range of 0  127 - Encoder wheels or faders. Patch changes from 0  127 - change from one instrument to another. Pitch bend wheel that has a 14-bit resolution. A section for MIDI time code, and other manufacturers System Exclusive information. In lighting, we often assign matching notes and controllers to common keys and wheels to synchronize playback. E.g. A GO Button on console A is configured to send Note #46, and a GO button on console B is configured to receive note #46. Pressing GO on console A console will press the GO on console B. In EDM shows, DJs frequently control lighting via MIDI touchpad controllers. MIDI Show Control or MSC - Not yet implemented is a significant Real Time System Exclusive extension of the international Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. MSC enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control. The MIDI Show Control protocol is an industry standard ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in 1991 which allows all types of entertainment control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications. Just like musical MIDI, MSC does not transmit the actual show media - it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance.. * Courtesy Wikipedia MIDI Time Code - Not yet implemented MIDI time code is similar to the SMPTE time code and is used to synchronize audio, video, and lighting equipment. Unlike SMPTE it does not use an audio signal. MIDI time code is available in the following frame rates:  24 frame/s (standard rate for film work)  25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video)  29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video)  30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video) Vibe can receive MIDI time code but does not generate MIDI time code. Local MIDI: MIDI is generated and received from the 5 pin DIN connectors on the back of the console. MIDI over USB: Transmits and receives MIDI over standard USB connectors. The device must be MIDI over USB class compliant to work with Windows without a driver. If the device has a Windows driver available it is recommended to install the driver for optimal results. MIDI over Ethernet: Windows class compliant MIDI over Ethernet is supported. Compulite VC MIDI over Ethernet is also supported. 22.2 General MIDI Configuration I/O General: General configuring Vibe MIDI: Connect all appropriate MIDI devices and power them on.

Select or type a previously recorded {Macro #} - the Macro # will appear in the the box. Tap the {Teach} key again to toggle it off. Press the or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up. Additional functions: Tap {Clear} followed by a MIDI grid box to clear its assignment. Tap {Clear All} to clear all MIDI assignments. Tap {Copy} followed by the source MIDI assignment and then the destination MIDI assignment to copy from one note to another. Tap {Move} followed by the source MIDI assignment and then the destination MIDI assignment to move the assignment from one note to another. 22.4 MIDI Show Control Midi Show Control was developed as a simple standard method of triggering basic commands on dissimilar devices. Basic MSC commands are: Go Stop Fire - Generally used for macros Also supported on receive are: All fixtures General lights Moving lights To receive MSC: Tap {Enable In} Match the {Device #} to number of the peer that will be sending the control commands. If the Peer # is above 111, select a Group # that matches and all devices set to that Group # will receive MSC packets. If the Peer # is 127 (Broadcast Mode) packets will be received on all devices regardless of their Device or Group numbers. To Transmit MSC: This function is currently under development.

The following is covered in this chapter: 24.1. Network Basics 24.2. Connecting to Compulite ePorts 24.3. Connecting to Art-Net and sACN Nodes 24.4. RDM 24.5. Connecting to Visualizers 24.1 Network Basics 24.1. Network Basics Vibe has two user accessible Ethernet networks: Data Network - Accessible via the two etherCON connectors on the rear panel.  Used for Art-Net, sACN, Compulite VC protocol nodes and Master/Slave backup. General Networks - Accessible via the two RJ45 connectors on the rear panel.  Used for Network storage of show files and remote diagnostics. Each network device must have its own unique static IP address in the form of four triplets xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, to identify it on the network. In Vibe, this can be set in the System Settings pop-up. It is not necessary to have three digits in each segment of the IP but there must be at least one digit in each segment. Vibe ships with a default Subnet Mask of 255.0.0.0 which means that it is only important that the first triplets of the IP, (the start address), must match on all devices in the network. Devices on the same network must not have identical IP addresses. Common Start addresses are: 10.x.x.x - Default for most ETC networks and alternate for Art-Net network IP. 2.x.x.x - Default for Art-Net networks. 192.x.x.x -Default for most MA consoles. Subnet Mask - Identifies the network itself and in conjunction with the IP address can be used to properly route network devices. 255.0.0.0. - Compulite Default. Only the first triplet must match. 255.255.0.0 - Also common. Compulite uses the third triplet as a console identifier in some of the products. The Vibe can be used in networks using a DHCP server but cannot act as a DHCP server. In all cases, the first triplets must match for devices to communicate with one another.. Switches: Vibe has two internal switches so single direct device to device connections are possible without a cross cable. When more than one device must be connected to the Vibe a good quality gigabit switch should be used. Many a system has gone down due to bad Ethernet cabling and cheap switches. It is recommended that etherCON connectors be used where possible in conjunction with professional grade switches designed for lighting and audio applications.. 24.2 Connecting to Compulite ePorts Compulite manufactures the ePort brand of DMX over Ethernet nodes. Supported Protocols: ePort 41 - Prior to Sept 2016 (check serial number with Compulite to confirm)  Compulite VC protocol  Art-Net v2 ePort-41 - Current  sACN pre-release and release versions  Art-Net 3  Compulite VC protocol ePort-8 and ePort-2  sACN pre-release and release versions  Art-Net 3  Compulite VC protocol For more product information, See: ePort Documents Before an ePort can be connected it should be configured using the CNET Manager software, available at the above link. Configuring ePorts: Make sure that the Vibe IP and the ePort IP are in the same range. Assign universes to each physical port by typing the universe number in the box below the icon of the physical connector. Select the DMX- ON-Ethernet protocol in the protocol list below the graphical display of the ePort. If the ePort is a newer model, sACN will also appear in the list. If Art-Net is selected make sure the Art-Net Subnet is also set. In most cases this will be set to 0 which allows the first 16 universes. It must be incremented by one with each new range of 16 universes Tap {Update} to apply all changes. 24.3 Connecting to Art-Net and sACN Nodes Vibe currently supports transmission of 256 universes of DMX over Ethernet using the industry standards of Art-Net versions 1  3, ad eACN (ANSI E1.31-2016 standard). Enable Art-Net or sACN output: Tap {DMX SETTINGS} in the patch toolbar found at the bottom of the Patch Workspace Template. The DMX Properties Pop-up will open. Under the Protocol heading, Tap {Art-Net} or {sACN} - The selection will turn red. Under Broadcast Options (VC, Art-Net, sACN) tap {Out} - The status indicator light will turn green. The console will now be outputting the selected protocol on the etherCON Data ports. The Vibe is capable of transmitting more than one protocol at a time. To save bandwidth it is also possible to enable only the universes for each protocol that are required. Vibe has separate universe patches for VCs, Art-Net, and sACN. By default, universes are patched 1 to 1 for each protocol. It is possible to reroute universe output destinations. Normally fixtures patched to console source universe 1 would be transmitted on Ethernet destination universe 1 but sometimes when multiple consoles are on line it is desirable to reroute universes to avoid conflicts. Source universe 1 for example could be rerouted to destination universe 101. The Vibe is licensed for 64, 96, 128, or 255 console source universes but these universes may be freely rerouted to any destination universe from 0  256 providing the total amount of universes does not exceed the purchased license. Reroute Console Universes: Under the Source Universe header, scroll the list to the source console universe number you wish to route from. Once tapped, the selection will turn red. A universe number may also be typed from the keypad. Under the Destination Universe header, tap one of the cells in the destination universe grid. The source universe number will now be routed through the destination universe number. Additional functions: Clear a destination universe - Tap {Universe #} in the destination grid. Tap {Clear}. Clear all destination universes - Select the protocol to clear. Tap {Clear All}. Reset default route for a single destination universe - Tap {Universe #} Tap {Config}. Reset all defaults for the selected protocol - Tap {Config All}. Art-Net Subnet View: Art-Net is designed in blocks of 16 universes. The blocks starts at subnet 0 and increments by 1 every 16 universes. The Subnet number and fixture number in the subnet may be viewed by toggling {Subnet View}. 24.4 RDM Currently, RDM is fully supported on the 8 physical DMX output ports and Compulite VC protocol. View RDM information: Open Patch Workspace. Tap the RDM tab in the lower right corner of the workspace. Tap {Get Devices} - The system will scan and display RDM compliant devices. If new devices are added, press {Re Scan}. Full RDM management will be available in future releases. 24.5 Connecting to Visualizers "],["masterslave.html", "Chapter 25 Master/Slave 25.1 Master/Slave", " Chapter 25 Master/Slave The following is covered in this chapter: Master/Slave 25.1 Master/Slave "],["working-with-multiple-consoles.html", "Chapter 26 Working with Multiple Consoles 26.1 Working with Multiple Consoles", " Chapter 26 Working with Multiple Consoles The following is covered in this chapter: - 26.
