The following is covered in this chapter: 1.1 Start Up 1.2 Guide Conventions 1.3 Important Terms 1.4 Software Capacity 1.5 Support 1.6 Releases 1.1 Start Up Power requirements: Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz. Approximately power consumption is 3.2A at 230V. Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector, or IEC C13 connector on the Vibey, ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country. Desk Light: Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console. Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Monitor intensity: Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Power up the console: Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks. Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector. Press the Power button located at the upper corner of the monitor panel. The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch. Power down the console: Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open. Tap {Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} popup will appear. Tap {Yes} or {No} to save or not the current show file. The Vibe application will shutdown. Press the Power button - The console will safely power off. 1.2 Guide Conventions [XXXX] - Physical key {XXXX} - Soft key [ ] { } - Example Press - Action applied to a physical key Tap - Action applied to a softkey or a virtual key Toggle - Action that actives and deactivates with alternating taps or presses Key - Any physical or virtual button Keypad - Embedded numeric keypad Keyboard - Console’s pull-out ASCII keyboard or any external keyboard SK - Object softkeys (Libraries, Groups, Snaps, Macros, etc.)  - Hint or suggestion RED - Important information or Caution [Here] - Short form for Press an appropriate destination key or button 1.3 Important Terms DMX 512 Output/Input Port - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter. DMX 512 Universe - Virtual DMX outputs 0 ⟶ 256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols. Compulite VC ArtNet sACN HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence) - When the same parameters are on two or more controllers, the highest value will output to the stage. Mainly used for dimmer values. LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence) - When the same parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output it’s values to the stage, no matter what the value is. Show - The file saved by the software containing all the programmed data. Layout - The file saved by the software containing all the visualization data. Window - An element of the layout that contains up to 12 Pages. When using multiple screens, each one can have its own window. Page - An element of the window that contains the Views. Vibe has three page types called Patch, Prog, Play. View - A single element that can be added to a Page, such as universe view, live view, timeline view, topo view, qlist tracksheet, and many others. HardKey - Any physical button on the console or its virtual equivalent on the screen. SoftKey - Any virtual button on the screen that corresponds to a stored element such as libraries, groups, qlists, scenes, macros, and snaps. Set = Fixture numbering system 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets) 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures) 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors) 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures) 4 = Servers (Video servers) 5 ⟶ 1000 = User defined sets Fixture - An independent object controlled by the console thorough DMX or network protocol, such as a conventional or LED luminaire, a moving head, or a media server. Parameter - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo wheel. Bank - A group of features of a fixture such as intensity, position, color, beam, image and shape. Encoder - A physical or virtual wheel used to control the values of the fixtures’ parameters. Editor - The part of the system that is used to program the fixtures and store the objects. Playback - The part of the system that is used to play the fixtures by triggering the stored objects. Smart Screen - A view on the Vibe software that controls the Editor and every parameter of the selected fixtures. In 2-screen consoles the Smart Screen is always shown on the small screen on the right side. Controller - Any physical or virtual control element that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots. Black Out - A physical or virtual button that inhibits the dimmer values of every fixture bringing them at 0%, often referred to as a B.O.. Grand Master - A physical or virtual control element that inhibits the dimmer values of every fixture, proportionate to their assigned value. Submaster - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values, proportionate to their assigned value. Master Controller - Main playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys. There can be only one Master Controller, but it can be assigned to any controller. Playback Master - A controller that is mastering other controllers. Slider - A slider potentiometer Controller, often referred to as a Fader. Qkey - A single button or a knob potentiometer Controller. Auxkey - A single button potentiometer Controller. Global - A slider potentiometer Controller. CrossFader - A pair of slider potentiometer Controllers used to manually control the fade in and fade out of consecutive Cues. TrackBall - Ay physical control element with a spheric shape used to focus moving fixtures through the Position parameters of Pan and Tilt. Qlist - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999. Chaser - A Qlist that is set to run automatically into a loop. Cue - A record contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values. Cue Zero - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid. Scene - A record that has the same properties of a Cue but exists independently from a Qlist. Library - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced. Options - Used to modify object properties “on the fly”. Settings - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created.  For the sake of this guide, Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets.  Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and the top label is the shifted function. 1.4 Software Capacity 256 DMX universes. 131072 DMX addresses. 1 physical/virtual CrossFader controller, with 2 non-motorized faders and 2 buttons. 5 physical/virtual Global Slider controllers with non-motorized slider and 1 button. 100 physical/virtual Slider Set controllers, with motorized fader and 3 buttons. 100 physical/virtual Qkey controllers with knob or single button. 100 physical/virtual AuxKey controllers with single button. 30 individual pages for Slider Sets, Qkeys, and AuxKeys. 9000+ total physical/virtual controllers. 1000 Qlists with virtually unlimited cues. 1000 Scenes. 1000 Fixture Groups. 1000 Libraries per each bank type. 1000 Effects. 1000 Snaps. 1000 Macros. 1000 Timelines. 1.5 Support Compulite Vibe Online Manual can be found at this link:  MANUAL Compulite Vibe Video Tutorials can be found on youtube:  TUTORIAL Compulite Support can be contacted for any programming issue.

"],["layout.html", "Chapter 3 Layout 3.1 Interface 3.2 Vibe Menu 3.3 Pages 3.4 Views 3.5 Layouts", " Chapter 3 Layout This chapter provides an overview of Vibe’s layout and GUI (Graphical User Interface). The following is covered in this chapter: 3.1 Interface 3.2 Vibe Menu 3.3 Pages 3.4 Views 3.5 Layouts 3.1 Interface Vibe has a multi-touch based interface, using simple gestures for selection and navigation. Supported Gestures: ◾ One finger or left mouse click to select. ◾ Two fingers or right mouse click to swipe and scroll. ◾ Long one finger press or left mouse click for drag&amp;drop. ◾ Multi-selection via ️️⤴ ⤵ (right-&gt;up /right-&gt;down) shaped gestures. Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added by using Display Port 1.2 or higher and MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large embedded screen called Vibe Main Screen is general-purpose, as well as the external monitors. The small embedded screen called Smart Screen is dedicated to context sensitive fixture information and interactive parameter pickers, used for Editor programming. Each screen, excluding the Smart Screen, can have one Window with an independent set of Pages. Each window can contain up to 12 Pages divided in 3 different Page Types: up to 4 Pages for PATCH up to 4 Pages for PROGRAM up to 4 Pages for PLAYBACK The page buttons, used to switch between the different pages, are specific to the monitor that has focus (the last touched or mouse selected screen). 3.1.1 Smart Screen The 11.6” multi-touch monitor embedded on the right Editor section of the Vibe console is referred to as the Smart Screen. Smart Screen On Vibe multi-screen console models the Smart Screen position is fixed on the dedicated monitor. The Smart Screen View cannot be moved on the other screens and the configuration of this screen cannot be customized. On Vibe single-screen console models and on Vibe PC the Smart Screen is a View, so it can be positioned on any layout Page. 3.1.2 Toolbars The left side of the Toolbar contains the Vibe Menu button, the Home Pages buttons, and the Command Line that shows the current syntax. The right side of the Toolbar, also referred to as the Editor Toolbar, contains a set of interactive buttons that are used to access less common commands. The Editor Toolbar shows a different set of buttons according to the programming syntax. Patch Toolbar Program Toolbar The functions of the Toolbar buttons are described in the following chapters. 3.2 Vibe Menu Vibe Menu can be opened at any time by tapping the {VIBE} key on the Toolbar. The Vibe Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped submenus. It is used to access common system functions such as Save Show and Exit, as well as to configure the Layout of the Pages. It contains all the Views listed in dedicated submenus. 3.2.1 Show Menu The Show Menu is used to manage Vibe show files. Open the Show Menu to access the following options: {New Show} - Start a new show. {Save Show} - Save the current show in the last defined directory. {Save Show As…} - Open a popup to name and save the current show (on Vibe DB or an external device). {Load Show} - Open a popup to load a saved show file (from Vibe DB or an external device). {Default Show} - Open the default Vibe show.

If Close is pressed, a popup asks to confirm. 3.3 Pages Vibe has 3 types of Pages: Patch Page Program Page Playback Page [Patch Page] or the F2 keyboard button switches between the existing Patch Pages. [Program Page] or the F3 keyboard button switches between the existing Program Pages. [Playback Page] or the F4 keyboard button switches between the existing Playback Pages. All the Pages are organized in the Pages View that can be accesses either by pressing the [VIEW] button or by tapping the {VIBE} Menu and then the {PAGES} key on the Toolbar. All Pages can be completely customized by adding, sizing and positioning the Views listed inside the Vibe Menu, independently from where the view is located inside the Vibe Menu. Pages can also be moved from one type to another, as soon as one of the 4 spaces per type is available. The Pages View can be unlocked through the Selection button in order to assign Home Pages, reorder the pages with drag and drop, Clone or Delete existent Pages.  On the Console it is recommended to set views such as the System Status and the Playback Status on the bottom of the Program and Playback pages, to have them in correspondence to the physical controllers. 3.3.1 Home Pages Home page buttons, located on the Taskbar, are a fast way to recall up to three main pages. Any page can be stored as a Home Page on the Page View. F1 keyboard button switches between the three Home Pages. The currently active Home Page is shown in Green. 3.3.2 Clone Pages Clone pages for a faster building of a similar layout page. The Clone Pages key is displayed on the Toolbar, near the menu, when the window is in View mode and it is unlocked by tapping the Selection key. 3.4 Views Vibe Views are listed inside the Vibe Menu, into the Patch, Program, Playback Views sub-menus. Any View can be added to any Page and stored in the layout. Views can be resized and tabbed together, but each view has its own dimension limits. To edit the placement of views on the layout, the {Lock} icon near the {VIBE} menu key must be toggled to unlock the layout editing. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the layout and allow normal usage. To configure the layout, any object in the Patch, Program and Playback Views hierarchical sub-menus can be tapped to open the view on a blank portion of the current page, or can be dragged and dropped into the page surface. Once on the page it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. This operation automatically unlocks the layout editing. If an object is dragged on top of another, both will turn green showing it is possible to tab them and create a tabbed view. Keep a tabbed view pressed to extract an object from the tab an move it separately. Here is the complete list of all the views that can be added to the layout pages to configure and customize the Vibe workspace. 3.4.1 Patch Views Fixtures - The list of all the fixtures created in the show.

View settings can be accessed when layout is Unlocked, by selecting the view and tapping the buttons on the toolbar. These settings are applied to the selected view. Toggle Scrollbar: add or remove a scrollbar to/from the view, if available. Toggle Frame: add or remove the frame to/from the view. Frame Color: customize the view’s frame for a better graphical separation between the views. Softkey Settings: any softkey view can be graphically customized by selecting it in layout edit mode and opening the settings popup with the {Settings} button on the toolbar. Softkey settings are used to change the size, font and color of the softkeys’ text and background. The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other views of the same tab, page, or to the softkey views in all the pages. The settings can be saved as default, and it is always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes. Some special color options are available to show color library softkeys with the colors that are stored in the library. The auto text color option in Softkey Settings popup automatically sets the softkey’s text color in black or white in contrast with the softkey’s background color, to make it always visible. Context Options only apply to the Context view. This view can show or hide the visualized objects depending on the user’s settings or on the smart option. The Context Normal Mode filters the visualized objects according to the enabled buttons. The Context Smart Mode filters the visualized objects automatically avoiding the softkeys that are already visible in the page. Single Button Settings: any single button view can be graphically customized by selecting it in layout edit mode and opening the settings popup with the {Settings} button on the toolbar. Specific settings, such as color and text size, can be assigned to each single button. The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other single buttons of the same tab, page, or to the buttons in all the pages. The settings can be saved as default, and it is always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes. Views Menu is availeble on some views, such as Live, Topo and Timeline. The View’s menu can be closed when the layout is Locked by tapping the Close Menu button. The Open Menu button can be placed wherever on the view with a long click gesture and drag. 3.5 Layouts After all pages and views are configured, the layout configuration can be saved into a Layout file by tapping the {VIBE} Menu and then the {LAYOUT} key. After configuring new windows on the external monitors, a layout file should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layout files store the configuration of external monitors and if the system is booted without the expected external monitor a warning message will appear. Layout files, containing all the graphical settings of pages and views, are loaded independently from the Show files, containing all the stored data.  Layout Files are particularly useful when the same desk is managed by different operators; each user can load his own customized layout without losing any show data programmed by the previous user. 3.5.1 Layout Settings Layout Settings can be accessed when layout is Locked, by tapping the Vibe Menu and then the {Setting} button on the toolbar, near the Lock and Pages buttons. These settings are applied as defaults to all the Pages and Views. It is possible to change the Vibe Theme, to move the Toolbar on top or bottom position on all the pages, and to set Default View Settings for the Headers, the Frames and the Scrollbars. "],["settings.html", "Chapter 4 Settings 4.1 System Settings 4.2 Network Settings 4.3 DMX Settings 4.4 I/O Settings 4.5 CITP Settings", " Chapter 4 Settings This chapter provides a description of Vibe’s software settings that can be customized. The following is covered in this chapter: 4.1 System Settings 4.2 Network Settings 4.3 DMX Settings 4.4 I/O Settings 4.5 CITP Settings 4.1 System Settings System Settings popup is accessed by selecting {System Settings} from the Vibe Menu, by tapping the [System Settings] single button key, or by tapping the {System Status} area in the system status view. 4.1.1 Editing Editing Properties Default Stage Value: Home Value: when released fixtures parameters return to their home values as specified in the device’s definition or user Home Scene. Maintain Last Value: when released fixture parameters remain at their current value, except for the dimmer. Auto Param Grouping: When enabled, parameters are grouped as follows: Bank Parameters Grouping Intensity Not Grouped Position Pan, Tilt Grouped Position Virtual X/Y/Z Grouped Color All Color Mix Grouped Color CMY Color Mix Grouped Color Color Wheels, Color Correction and misc Not Grouped Beam Any Param Not Grouped Image Any Param Not Grouped Shape Blade Depth, Angle, Rotation - Per Blade Grouped Clear Editor After Store: After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until [RESET] or [VIBE] + [RESET] is pressed. Automatically Assign Cues to PB: After storing a cue, it is automatically assigned to the Master Controller. Editor Flash: Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature. {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values) Defaults are {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%) Qlist Behaviour: Tracking / Non-Tracking: Tracking: Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values. Non-Tracking: Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero. In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the Store Options {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors. Clear Editor on Master GO: The editor will be reset when GO on the Master Controller is pressed. Store Scene by Default: By default [STORE] [HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue. Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax [STORE] [CUE] [HERE] (press any controller button). Next Cue Increment: When [Store] [Here], [STORE] [STORE], or [STORE] [ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used. If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20. Apply Compulite Mode: Sets a number of default settings to emulate the traditional non-tracking Compulite Mode. Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value} {Clear Editor After Store} = Off {Automatically Assign Cues to PB} = Off Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking} ON Value: Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the [ON] key is pressed. {First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing [ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default. Restore Defaults: {Restore Popup Positions} - Restores the position of the popups that have been moved. {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set. {Restore Factory} - Restores settings changes to factory defaults. {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to show specific defaults. 4.1.2 Timing Timing Properties Default Back Time: Default Time used when the [Back] or [Hold Back] Buttons are pressed. Default Assert: Default Time used when a controller’s parameters are reasserted with the [ASSERT] [HERE] command. Default GOTO Time: Default Time used whith the GOTO command. GOTO time can be overridden using command [GOTO] [CUE] [#] [TIME] [Value] [ENTER]. Default Release Time: Default Fade out time for parameters being released from the editor using the [RESET] or [RELEASE] keys, or Controllers being released from the stage using the controller [RELEASE] button. Use Cue Time: The Back, Asset and GOTO times may be seet to use the Cue Time as default by enabling the [Use Cue Time] button. Look Ahead: Set All Controllers On will enable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Set All Controllers Off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Once all is set ON individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time. Once all is set OFF individual controllers may enable Look Ahead at any time. System Time: System Time (Editor Time) is applied to values being introduced into the editor and other miscellaneous features that do not otherwise have their own timing settings. 4.1.3 Hardware Hardware Properties Panel Backlight: Inactive keys: Adjusts the LED backlight level of keys that are not valid in the current operational state and the LED backlight level of controllers that are unassigned. Active Keys: Adjusts the LED backlight level of keys that may be used in the current operational state and the LED backlight level of controllers that have objects assigned. Operating System: Opens relevant Windows setting screen to adjust the OS settings. 4.1.4 Defaults Defaults are the customizable initial settings for most system objects. 4.1.4.1 Controller Settings Default Controller Settings The popup contains all the settings referred to the controller, independently from the object loaded. Controller Settings are divided into: Flash Behavior Slider Behavior Properties Priority Flash behavior: Release On Release - While a Flash button is depressed, the controller will assert its values, when released the controller will be released from affecting the stage. Pure LTP - Pressing a Flash key reasserts overridden LTP values from another controller but does not release them when the flash key is released.

Prevent from Paging - Locks a Qlist or Scene to the current page. Paging ⤴ or ⤵ will not affect the Qlist or Scene on the controller. Prevent from Grab - The Grab command will not capture the controller’s active parameters. Priority Virtual Priority Wheel - Sets the controller’s LTP group number. Controllers assigned higher numbers cannot be overridden by lower numbers. Controllers assigned the same number will be LTP among themselves. Values may be entered using the virtual wheel or directly by tapping the middle of the center area of the wheel and typing a value from the keypad. Restore defaults Resets Controller settings to their last stored configuration. 4.1.4.2 Controller Actions Default Controller Actions The popup contains all the actions that can be assigned to the controller, depending on the object type (Qlist, Chaser, Scene, Submaster). Controller Actions are divided into: Slider Controller: 1 fader + 3 buttons A/B Crossfader: dual fader + 2 buttons Other Controllers: 1 fader + 1 button When a Scene is configured as a Group Submaster it has a unique set of functions and button options. 4.1.4.3 Snap Settings Load Pages: Snap will change the current page to the page the Snap was stored in.

This includes tracked values, home values and dimmer values at zero. {All Param For Selected} All parameters from the fixture selection will be turned red and stored in the cue. 4.1.4.10 Library Store Options Library settings are the same for all the following library types: Intensity Position Color Beam Image Shape Custom *Default Library Settings: Library Type - Set the library behavior between Fixture Specific, Parameter Specific, Pattern, Device+Fixture, Device+Parameter, Device+Pattern. Reference - Set the library to be referenced in Cues, Scenes and Effects. Timing - Set the library to include time values or not. Filters - Open the Library Filters popup. Effect Library settings also include two additional options: Include Base - If toggled on, the start points of parameters will be stored with the Effect making them “Absolute Effects”. Randomize - If toggled on, every time the library is assigned in the editor the order of selected fixtures will be randomized. When storing a randomized effect into a Scene or a Cue, the order will be kept as it was at the moment of storing. 4.1.4.11 Library Filters Library Defaults: The popup window is used to edit, for each bank, which parameters will be filtered by the library. Select the library bank from the Library column, then tap the parameters in the Available box to add them to the Filtered box, so that the library will store them. Select the library bank from the Library column, then tap the parameters in the Filtered box to add them to the Available box, so that the library will NOT store them. Restore Defaults button will recover the default parameters assignment. General: The popup window is used to create and edit the Filters that can be used on-the-fly when storing libraries, cues and scenes. The keys on the left side are used to create, delete or renumber Filters and to assign them a name and a specific softkey color. The Available and Filtered parameters boxes are used to defin the parameters that the filter is going to be applied to. 4.1.5 System Auto Save: The show file can be automatically saved at predefined time intervals. Auto save function can be enabled or disabled in the system settings tab, with the option to assign saving time intervals. System Units: Vibe can be set to use either metric or imperial units for stage measurement. Auto Recover: Vibe is made up of four modules: GUI - Graphic User Interface - The windows app with the Vibe graphics. LPU - Lighting Processing Unit - Calculates and outputs the show data. HAL - Hardware Access Layer - Connects the panels and devices to the Vibe. SQL DataBase - Data management. LPU and HAL Status LEDs are on the status box: In the case of an unexpected halt, the toggled on modules will attempt a restart. In the case of an unexpected halt with modules untoggled, the user can attempt a restart manually by tapping the Recover keys. There is no option to Auto Recover the database as it is always up to date. Lock Screen Image The Lock Screen Image can be customized by loading a different image. Lock screen is shown when system is locked or when Vibe is waiting for the Fixture Builder to be exit. 4.2 Network Settings Network Settings popup is accessed by selecting {Network Settings} from the Vibe Menu or by tapping the [Network Settings] single button key.

The following is covered in this chapter: 5.1 Sets 5.2 Devices 5.3 Create and Patch 5.4 DMX Properties 5.5 Fixture View 5.6 Address Properties 5.7 Park 5.8 Clone 5.9 Replace 5.10 Calibration 5.1 Sets Vibe contains an extensive Device Library with DMX parameter mapping for fixtures, media servers, and common miscellaneous devices like smoke machines. Before a device can be programmed it must be imported and patched to DMX addresses. Vibe has an advanced numbering system that allows devices to be grouped into five familiar categories called SETS. The Default Sets are Fixture, Channel, Spot, Matrix, Media Server. Additional custom SETS may also be created. Fixture numbering in all sets can be freely changed if there are no overlapping numbers. Each Set has a unique ID. Set ID numbers: 0 = [Fixture] is a special global numbering set that must also reference one of the other sets. All devices must be assigned a Fixture number and one of the other set numbers. 1 = [Channel] is a numbering set that would normally be used for conventional single parameter devices. 2 = [SPOT] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for multi-parameter devices like moving lights. 3 = [MATRIX] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for RGB or other non-moving LED fixtures, also useful for pixel mapping devices. 4 = [SERVER] is a numbering system used for media servers. Each SET may have Fixtures numbered from 1 ⟶ 999999 To patch a device, you must first move focus to the main monitor and press the [PATCH] Workspace Template key. By default, the first page will contain all the displays needed for patching. 5.1.1 Add Sets The option to add a user-created set is done via the Sets view. To Add a Set Add a Sets view: Open Vibe menu Tap Patch Tap Sets On the Sets view tap the Add icon on the header On the popup define the set’s name and number Tap apply 5.1.2 Edit Sets There is an option to edit a user-created set. This is done via the Sets view. To Edit a Set Add a Sets view: Open Vibe menu Tap Patch Tap Sets On the Sets view select a user-created set Tap the Edit icon on the header 5.2 Devices Once the Patch Page is open: Use the Devices view. Tap {Import}, the Manufactures picker list will appear. Flick or drag along the list to browse to the desired manufacturer then tap the manufacturer’s name. A new list and search window will open. If the exact device name is known, type it in the search window, if not flick or drag to browse the list until the desired device is found. The &lt; key may be pressed at any time to return to the imported Devices list. 5.2.1 Advanced Search Fixtures may be searched directly by name using the Advanced Device Search. Searches may be filtered by parameter order and DMX Channel Count to limit the search.  The filters are very helpful in finding close matches for fixtures that are not currently in the device library. To access Advanced Search: Tap {Import} on the Devices view header - The tab will show {Advanced Search}. Tap {Advanced Search} - The Advanced Search Pop-up will appear. Type the fixture’s name in the Fixture Name box, set the number of channels, or select the parameters to filters the devices database. Select the fixture from the Matching Devices list. The DMX Modes pop-up will open. Review the DMX chart and select the desired mode. Tap Apply or Import or press [ENTER] to close the popup and add the fixture to the Imported Devices list. 5.3 Create and Patch To open the Create and Patch popup: Import the desired device. The device will now be in the list below the Imported Devices header. Tap the device you wish to patch and the Create and Patch Fixtures popup will appear. To Create and Patch fixtures: In the Create and Patch pop-up, type the quantity in the red highlighted field via the keypad or flick/drag to browse the list until the desired quantity number is found then tap the number. If the Quantity number is not highlighted in Red, tap the field to make it active. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap in the {SET} field. The appropriate SET for the selected fixture should automatically be selected, but as some fixtures don’t always cleanly fit into standard categories, check that the correct Set is selected. If not, flick/drag to browse to the correct SET then tap it. You may also type the Set number (0-5). Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the {Set Number} field. Set the Channel, Spot, Matrix, or Server number for the fixture in the red highlighted field using the keypad or scroll to browse the list until the desired start number is found, then tap the number.  By default, the first available number for the selected SET is pre-assigned. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any box in the Fixture Number field to select it. By default, the same number as the SET Number will appear as the Fixture Number. Many users like to group Fixtures by 10ʼs or 100ʼs so it is common to type 101 for the start of one type of fixture, 201 for a second type and so on. The SET number and Fixture number do not have to be the same. Next to the Fixture Number field is a data entry box that displays the fixture’s default short name. This may be edited at any time while in this pop-up. The name will be updated when the fixtures are created upon closing the popup. In the second section of the pop-up, fixtures that were selected for creation can be patched via the DMX patch wizard. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap a number in the UNIVERSE field. If the desired universe is not visible, flick/drag to browse to the correct universe number then tap it. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any number in the ADDRESS field.  By default, the interval between fixtures of the same type is fixed. Using the INTERVAL field, a custom interval may be set. To complete CREATE and PATCH tap the {APPLY &amp; CONTINUE} key in the bottom right corner of the popup, Press [ENTER], or tap Apply to close the popup and return to the patch workspace. Theatrical Multi-Patching can also be done manually using keypad syntax: Toggle off the {MAIN PATCH} key at the top of the DMX patch wizard before closing the pop-up. The fixtures will be created but will remain unpatched. To Patch fixtures using traditional keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] [ADDRESS] [#].[#]  By default, the first available DMX address of the selected Universe will be shown in the ADDRESS field. If the default start address is not appropriate, type or scroll the list to the desired start address and tap it.Universe.Address, [STORE]. Or [ADDRESS] [#].[#] +/ - ⟶ [#].[#] [FIXTURE] [#] [STORE].  Addresses may also be typed in absolute format: 1 ⟶ 32,768 (64 Universes standard). The system will automatically assign the correct universe.  When starting from a {New Show} only {Physical DMX outputs} are enabled. Network universes must be enabled in PATCH {DMX Settings} 5.3.1 Drag and Drop Patch If {Main Patch} is toggled off in the Create and Patch pop-up, fixtures can be created but not patched. Created fixtures may then be dragged and dropped onto the Universe View. Drag and Drop from the Fixtures tab: Create fixtures. Select the Fixture Set you wish to patch from the Set list. Select a destination Universe from the Universes list. The universe grid will be shown in the Universes view. Select the Fixtures you wish to patch from the Fixtures list.  Multiple fixtures may be selected by swiping ⤴ or ⤵ in the Fixtures list. Press and Hold the fixtures, they will turn into floating icons. Drag the fixture icons from the Fixtures view onto the Universe View grid. All associated DMX addresses will turn green. Drop the fixture icon on the desired DMX start address The fixtures are now patched. Make multiple selections of fixtures using the keypad: Type a range of fixtures using the keypad - the fixture selection will be displayed numerically in the Selection box. Press and Hold anywhere in the Selection box - a fixture icon will appear. Drag the icon to the Universe View grid and drop it at the destination start address. The range of fixtures is now patched. Multi-Patch using Drag and Drop: Drag and drop the same fixture to multiple DMX offsets.  All types of fixtures may be multi-patched but caution should be used when multi-patching multi-parameter fixtures. Unpatch fixtures using drag and drop: Press and Hold any patched DMX offset - The DMX addresses for the fixtures patched to it will turn green and a fixture icon will be shown. Drag the selected block of fixtures towards the bottom of the screen - a waste bin icon will appear. Drag the block until the icon is over the waste bin and drop the fixtures. The fixtures are now unpatched. 5.3.2 Modify Patch Once patched fixtures can be modified using keypad syntax or using the Patch Toolbar. {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens the Clear Patch popup. {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens the Delete Fixtures popup. {CLONE} - Opens the Fixture Cloning popup. {REPLACE} - Opens the Device Replacement popup. {ADD FIXTURE} - Opens the Create And Patch popup. {PATCH} - Opens the Patch Fixture popup. {RENUMBER} - Opens the Renumber Fixture popup. {AUTO GENERATE} - Opens the Auto Generate popup. {FIXTURE CALIBRATION} - Opens the Fixture Calibration popup. Modify the patch using keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - From the Editor toolbar. [FIXTURE] [#] [DELETE] - Only works in the Patch Page. 5.3.3 Address Test Sometimes, especially in theatrical environments, it is useful to check if a DMX channel is empty or not. This can be done from the console by enabling the Address Test function on the header of the Universe View. In Address Test mode each selected channel is visualized with a yellow background and it is forced to jump at full intensity. Many channels can be selected by dragging or through multiple touches. [RESET] releases the channels and disables the Address Test function. Once the function is disabled all the channels come back to their normal state. 5.4 DMX Properties By default, DMX is mapped to the physical ports on a 1:1 basis. DMX can be remapped to anyone of the supported 256 DMX universes. 5.4.1 Local Output Remap Local Outputs: Open the {DMX SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the DMX Settings button - The DMX Properties popup will open. In the Protocol column, Tap {Local Output}. Under the Source Universe heading, tap the desired source universe number or once red type the universe number you wish to be the source. Under the Local Output Destination Universe heading, tap one of the displayed local outputs - the source Universe will now be patched to the output. Change output to input Currently Vibe supports 2 inputs but multiple connectors may be assigned to the same input. Tap a patched output - Two additional options will light up near the Output Destination Universe box. {Make Input 1} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 1. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. {Make Input 2} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 2. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. Change input back to output: Tap a patched input - an additional Make Output option will light up near the Output Destination Universe box. Tap {Make Output} - The Connector will now output DMX. Change DMX refresh rate: Sometimes older equipment cannot handle the higher refresh rates, so it may be reduced with the DMX Max Rate wheel. It is not recommended to go below 28Hz as some flickering may be observed. 5.4.2 VC 5.4.3 ArtNet 5.4.4 sACN 5.4.5 DMX Input The following objects may be mapped to DMX inputs: DMX input mapped directly to the console’s DMX outputs DMX input mapped to Fixtures DMX input mapped to Controllers DMX input mapped to Macros Map a DMX output to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [ADDRESS] [#] Press [STORE] [ADDRESS] [1] {INPUT PATCH TO} [ADDRESS] [1] [STORE] - When DMX 1 is received from an external source like a console, DMX 1 will directly output to the Vibe DMX output. No values will be shown in the live display as no actual parameters are involved. Map a range of DMX outputs to a range of DMX inputs: Press [ADDRESS] [#] ⟶ [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [ADDRESS] [#] ⟶ [#] Press [STORE] Map a Fixture to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [Fixture] [#] Press [STORE] DMX inputs will automatically be mapped to all the fixtures parameters starting at the specified address. [ADDRESS] [1] [FIXTURE] [1] (A fixture with 42 parameters) [STORE] will automatically match the 42 parameters to input addresses 1 → 42. The next fixture would have to be mapped starting at address 43. Map a controller to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [PLAY-B] (Controller) - The Controller Selection popup will appear. Choose the Controller Type, Page Number, and Controller number from the popup. Press ENTER, or tap Apply to close the popup and complete the patch. Map a Macro to a DMX input - Macro will trigger at 50% Press [ADDRESS] [#].[#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [MACRO] [#] Press [STORE] Delete a DMX Input patch assignment: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [DELETE] 5.4.6 DMX In/Out View DMX Output and Input view is meant to show in real time the output and input values of each DMX channel of the selected universe. Use the view’s menu to select the target output or input universe. DMX values can be shown in numeric or in graphic visualization. 5.5 Fixture View The fixture view lists all the created fixtures and their patch information. Select a Set on the Sets View to filter the fixtures listed. Use the Fixture# column to select the fixtures and the [DESELECT] button to release the selection. Selected fixtures will be highlighted in yellow. Renumber Fixtures Tap on the Set or on the Set number column of a fixture selection, or tap the {RENUMBER} key on the patch toolbar, to change the fixture Set and ID. Rename Fixtures Tap on the name column of a fixture selection to change the fixture Name. Renaming multiple fixtures at once is possible by using the # at the end of the text. Re-patch Fixtures Tap on the DMX Address column of a fixture selection, or tap the {PATCH} key on the patch toolbar, to change the fixture address. Change Fixtures’ Mode Tap on the Mode column of a fixture selection to change the fixture mode. Different personalities of the same device need to be imported in the show. Invert Pan/Tilt Tap on the Pan Invert, Tilt Invert, Pan/Tilt Swap columns of a fixture selection to change the fixture position parameters’ behavior. 5.6 Address Properties The address view lists all the DMX addresses of the selected universe and their properties. Each cell contains the properties of a DMX address and the icon of the parameter patched on it. To edit address properties, tap on the addresses to select them and then “Address Properties” on the header. The Address Properties popup will open. The following address properties can be edited: Proportional Level: limits the highest value that the address can reach. Base: limits the lowest value that the address can reach. Curve: assigns to the address a specific curve. Default is a Fade In curve. Grand Master: defines if the address is under the Grand Master’s control. Default is ON for the dimmer parameters and OFF for the other parameters. Restore Defaults: restores the default address properties. 5.7 Park Park an address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park popup will appear. Set a DMX level from 0 ⟶ 255 using the virtual slider. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to close the popup and park the address. Unpark an address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park popup will appear. Tap {Clear Park}. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to close the popup and unpark the address. Park a fixture: [FIXTURE] [#] {PARK} [STORE] Fixture will now be parked at the current values. Unpark a fixture: [FIXTURE] [#] {PARK} [DELETE] Park a parameter: [FIXTURE] [#] {PARAMETER} {PARK} [STORE] The Parameter will now be parked at the editor value. View parked fixtures and address: In the Exam view tap Patch and then Park to check all the parked addresses and fixtures. &gt; The Grandmaster does not affect parked addresses and fixtures. &gt; The [B.O.] key does blackout parked addresses and fixtures. 5.8 Clone Vibe has smart and advanced clone features. The Fixture Cloning feature allows to copy all the stored data from a selection of fixtures to another one. To open the fixture cloning popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page’s Editor Toolbar. Choose the order of source fixtures on the left column and the order of destination fixtures on the right column, then press Done. Vibe will provide a smart fixture cloning keeping the fixtures’ data as similar as possible. Selection Rules: All source fixtures must be of the same type. All destination fixtures must be of the same type. Many fixtures can be cloned to many fixtures, but the amount must be the same. It is possible to select 1 source and many destinations. The fixture cloning operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button. Exchange Clone The Cloning option on the top can be set as a one sided or a two-sided clone. A one-sided clone copies the stored data from the source to the destination fixtures only. A two-sided clone, called Exchange Clone, makes a smart replacement of data from the source fixtures to the destination fixtures and vice versa. Advanced Clone The Advanced fixture cloning option on the top enables access to a pair of Next popup windows where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced, and customized by the user. The next step shows the Parameter Selection window. The cloning can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters’ levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture’s functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart. On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart. The next step shows the Data window. The Data window permits to filter the Groups, Libraries, Qlists, Scenes and Submasters, to apply the cloning only to the selected contents. Default is that all are selected. NOTE: on the exchange option, these lists will show objects from both source and destination fixtures. There is an option to clone the calibration data, so the destination fixture will get the same location coordinates as the source fixture. Default is Disabled, because in real world 2 fixtures cannot have the same physical position, but can be enabled, for example in case of fixture switches or if working on a 3D visualizer trying different lighting setups on the same rig. There is an option to clone the look ahead mask so if the source fixture is in the mask, then the destination fixtures will also be in the mask. Default is Enabled. There is an option to choose what to do with the parameters of the destination fixtures that are not included in the clone because they were not matched or any other reason. Merge means to keep these values, overwrite will delete the values. Default is Overwrite. 5.9 Replace Vibe has smart and advanced device replacement. The Device replacement feature allows to replace a device with another one, keeping all the matching data stored. To open the device replacement popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page’s Editor Toolbar. Choose the Source device on the left column and the new device from the Imported Devices on the right column, then press Done. Vibe will provide a smart device replacement keeping the fixtures’ data as similar as possible. The device replacement operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button. Advanced Replacement The Advanced replacement option on the top enables access to a Next popup window where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced and customized by the user. The next step shows the Parameter Selection window. Each bank has its option to enable/disable. Enabled means it will be included in the Device replacement and disabled means it will not be included. Default is enabled. The replacement can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters’ levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture’s functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart. On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart. 5.10 Calibration {Fixture Calibration} key on the Patch Toolbar opens a popup used to calibrate the fixtures through the XYZ coordinates, either taken from a 3D Visualizer or from a real measurement. When fixtures are properly calibrated it is possible to specify a stage point on Vibe xyz position picker to automatically point all the fixtures on it. Another advantage of the fixture calibration is to speed up the creation of topographical views (Topo). There are few passages to get the calibration data of the fixtures from third party software, that depend on which visualizer is used. 5.10.1 Wysiwyg On Vibe, go to [PATCH] page and tap on {FIXTURE CALIBRATION}. Tap on {Stage} button and set the stage dimensions. Specify the drawing origin point at the center of the stage. For this, it will be necessary to work in the CAD tab using the TOP view. Press on the top left corner (that connects the vertical ruler and the horizontal ruler – (see Blue Frame), and select the option of ’Mover Ruler (Set View Origin)ʼ. Select the center of your stage (see Red Arrow in the Picture) Go to ‘Data tab’, press Option on the toolbar ⟶ Document Options ⟶ Draw Defaults - and change the units to metric.. Copy these values (manually) to the Fixture calibration table in Vibe: the column X to the column X, the column Y to the column Y, the column Z to the column Z. After all values are in the Vibe fixture calibration table, select the X column (by tapping the header) and press [-]. Fixtures are now calibrated. 5.10.2 Capture On Vibe, go to [PATCH] page and tap on {FIXTURE CALIBRATION}. Tap on {Stage} button and set the stage dimensions. Place the center of the stage in the intersect point of the 2 Bold Axis, when the CAD displays a view from the Top Go to Tools ⟶ Options and change the measurements to metric. Select a fixture in Capture to see the XYZ coordinates when the table is showing ’Selected Itemsʼ. Copy these values (manually) to the Fixture calibration table in Vibe: the column X to the column X, the column Y to the column Z, the column Z to the column Y. After all values are in the Vibe fixture calibration table, select the X column (by tapping the header) and press [-], and select the Y column and press [-]. Fixtures are now calibrated. 5.10.3 L8 Coming Soon. 5.10.4 VectorWorks Coming Soon. 5.10.5 Depence Coming Soon. "],["editor.html", "Chapter 6 Editor 6.1 Concept 6.2 Syntax 6.3 Selection 6.4 Editor 6.5 Groups 6.6 Grab", " Chapter 6 Editor This chapter introduces to the editor, explaining the concept and syntax, then describing the ways of making fixture selections. The following is covered in this chapter: 6.1 Concept 6.2 Syntax 6.3 Selection 6.4 Editor 6.5 Groups 6.6 Grab 6.1 Concept The Vibe is an advanced lighting control system designed to simplify programming in all styles of Entertainment lighting. To simplify programming, Vibe uses an abstract layer that allows fixtures of different hardware types to be presented to the user in a universal way. Fixtures are programmed on the Editor either by using the programming syntax with the HardKeys or the Smart Screen pickers and features. The dedicated graphical “Smart Screen” presents global pickers for most parameters including: Intensity picker for dimmer values and strobe effects Position picker with P/T and XYZ Trackpad HSV color picker (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) Wheel picker for Gobo, Prism, Animation and Color wheels Beam picker for Iris, Zoom, Focus and Frost effects Blade picker for framing system Real World Units Where possible picker values are displayed in “Real World” units XYZ P/T in degrees Strobe in HZ Color in HSV 0-360 degrees Zoom in degrees Virtual Parameters To make it easier to work with fixtures using different color systems and XYZ tracking systems, Vibe creates virtual parameters that may not exist in the physical fixture. Some examples are: Virtual Intensity for controlling LED fixtures that do not have a dimmer parameter. Virtual HSV as a common denominator for all color mixing systems of Multi-color fixtures, such as CMY, RGB, RGBA, RGBW, RGBACL, … Virtual XYZ coordinates for calibration of fixtures that only have physical Pan/Tilt parameters. Tracking Mode Vibe by default is a tracking console and follows the conventions of modern show lighting. Vibe also has a special track feature called SKIP: if cues are modified using SKIP, instead of Qonly, the relationship with the original hard value is maintained and changes to the original value skip over the modification and preserve the track. Qonly Mode Modifications, insertions and deletions will be done Qonly by default. Move fades will still be valid. Non-Tracking or Compulite Mode Vibe can also program without tracking, by applying the Compulite Mode. Using Compulite Mode the defaults are changed to: Tracking turned off. Editor is not cleared after a Store. After Reset, Editor values mantain their last position instead of returning to home values. Controllers do not advance to the Cue after a Store. Color spaces Vibe can work in three color spaces: HSV: Color for all types of fixtures can be set using the Color picker or the HSV parameter wheels. HSV virtual parameters are stored in Cues and Libraries just like physical parameters. Automatically CMY or RGB values (or any color mixing parameter of the fixture) will be displayed, but not directly referenced in cues using virtual HSV. RGB, CMY, other: If color values are set by using the real color mixing parameters, physical values are stored in the cue and HSV values will be displayed but not directly referenced. Virtual crossfading By default the color and position crossfading is done by using the physical color parameters, but any Cue can be assigned to crossfade the virtual parameters instead. Maintain Selection To avoid reselecting fixtures after a STORE command, Vibe maintains its selection on reset of the editor. To clear the editor and the fixture selection [VIBE] (Shift) + [RESET] must be pressed. 6.2 Syntax Vibe uses a hybrid command syntax, called action syntax, that does not need an “enter” command to complete the sequences For keypad command line driven operations the command completes the sequence, the logic is: Source Object, Filter, Options, Command (Action Completes) [Group 1] [Full] [Library 2 (Position) 1] [Cue 1] [Store Options] {Red + White} [Store] For softkeys and controllers driven operations touching the object completes the sequence, the logic is: Source Object, Filter, Command, Options, Destination (Object Completes) {GROUP} [1] [Full] [LIBRARY] {Position} [3] [Store] [Store Options] {Red Only} press any button on [Controller 1] The Command Line is the area where commands appear as they are entered. It is located on the Toolbar on the side of the [VIBE] menu. When in BLIND Mode the command line is bounded in yellow. The Selection Line is the area where the active fixture selection appears. It is located on the Smart Screen. It shows the current fixture selection in the selection order. 6.3 Selection In this guide FIXTURE will be the default SET, but any SET (Channel, Spot, Matrix, Server, User Sets) could also be applicable. Default SET is changed by double pressing the appropriate SET key Dimmer is implied, but parameter would normally be specified after [+ ⟶ -] and before value. [CE] will backspace the command line one character at a time. [Shift CE] will clear the command line to the beginning and put the system in an idle state. Fixtures are selected using the [FIXTURE] key on the keypad. Fixtures on different Sets may be selected using the syntax [SET] [#] [FIXTURE] [#]. Fixtures may be stored in Groups and recalled using the [GROUP] key. Fixtures may also be interactively selected via the Live, the Live Parameter and the Topo views. [+] [-] keys are valid with Fixture selections and Groups. [FIXTURE] . (dot) reselects the last selection. [FIXTURE] reselects all fixtures in the Editor. [CE] backspaces the command line one character at a time, but currently will not go back one command at a time. [VIBE] + [CE/CLEAR] clears the command line. [RELEASE] removes the parameters from the Editor. First press releases the active parameters (last adjusted) for selected fixtures. Second press releases all remaining parameters for selected fixtures. [DESEL] deselects all fixtures but maintains the values in the Editor. This function is usually used to protect the operator from accidentally adjusting parameters in the Editor when they are temporarily captured. It may also be used to “idle” the command line to allow [TEXT] {SK} function while fixtures are still in the Editor. [RESET] releases all parameters from the Editor. [VIBE] + [RESET] releases all parameters from the Editor and deselects all the fixtures. [NEXT] / [PREV] increments or decrements fixtures in a selection. When used with a Group, will be confined to the fixtures in the Group. [VIBE] + [NEXT] / [PREV] increments or decrements fixtures in a selection, keeping the fixtures’ amount and distance. Command logic and shortcuts [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [Full] / [Zero] (@100 and @00). [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [@] enter value. Two digits are required to complete value entry.

(There’s a toolbar equivalent) Fixture ⟶ = Reselect Editor. (There’s a toolbar equivalent) Fixtures and Parameters may be deselected using [RELEASE / DESEL] Key. This leaves values in the editor but not under the control of the wheels. [GROUP] # selects all fixtures that are recorded into the group. *The typed fixture order is preserved in a recorded group. With groups, parameters may be fanned via syntax as above, but their recorded order will be considered. Control without having to press Shift, Reset, which clears the values in the Editor. {LIBRARY} {LIBRARY}, will select and enter values from a library into the Editor. This is especially useful when using position libraries as groups with positions. 6.3.1 Selection Tools Selection button allows to split the fixtures’ selection. Press [SELECTION] on Prog and Play pages’ toolbar to access the features. Press [RESTORE] to get back to the original selection. Press [LOCK] to make the current selection as the new base selection. Press [CE/CLEAR] to return to the upper toolbar’s menu. Selection toolbar has the following Selection Tools. {ODDS} - Absolute odd number in the range {EVENS} - Absolute even numbers in the range {2/1} - Grouping of 2 starting at the first fixture of the range (relative odd numbers) {2/2} - Grouping of 2 starting at the second fixture of the range (relative even numbers) {3/1} - Grouping of 3 starting at the first fixture of the range {4/1} - Grouping of 4 starting at the first fixture of the range { / } - Grouping of #/# starting at the # fixture of the range [Fixture] [1] [⟶] [14] {Selection Tools} [3] {/} [1] - would select fixtures 1,4,7,10,13 as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/1 will be displayed on the selection line. [Fixture] [1] [⟶] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [2] - would select fixtures 2,5,8,11,14 as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/2 will be displayed on the selection line. 6.3.2 Order Tools Order button allows to make changes to the fixtures’ selection order. Press [ORDER] on Program and Playback pages’ toolbar to access the features. Press [RESTORE] to get back to the original selection. Press [CE/CLEAR] to return to the upper toolbar’s menu. Order toolbar has the following Ordering Tools. {INVERT} - Inverts the selection order linearly {MIRROR IN} - Mirrors the selection order from the extremes to the center {MIRROR OUT} - Mirrors the selection order from the center to the extremes {TRANSPOSE} - Transposes the raws and columns of the selection order (useful for matrixes) {PATTERN} - Opens the Pattern popup with more advanced reordering tools Transpose Transpose feature is used to reorder fixture selection based on a specified offset. This is particularly useful for creating interesting effects and fanning. Fixture 1 ⟶ 12 {Transpose} 2 [ENTER] = 1+3+5+7+9+11+2+4+6+8+10+12 Fixture 1 ⟶ 12 {Transpose} 3 [ENTER] = 1+4+7+10+2+5+8+11+3+6+9+12 Fixture 1 ⟶ 12 {Transpose} 4 [ENTER] = 1+5+9+2+6+10+3+7+11+4+8+12 Pattern Pattern feature is used to edit the selection order by using smart functions on a graphical interface. The Pattern popup also includes all the other Order Tools. It can be used prior to entering the Advanced Effects editor to create more complex block patterns that are available using the basic {Block Of} and {Sub-Block Of} key in the effects editor. Make a fixture selection Tap {Pattern} on the Editor Toolbar - The Pattern popup will open.  This is not an effect even though it is a dynamic display. Tap the indicator at the top of the displayed fixtures. - it turns white. Select a number under the Block Size header. Tap the {Spread} icon. - the columns will expand to show the new fixture order. If desired make further order changes under the Offset Header and tap {offset} icon. Make further modifications or reset the selection with the {Reset} {Invert} {Transpose} and {Invert Columns} keys. Once finished, exit the popup by pressing Apply or [ENTER]. Open the Advanced Effects editor and program the desired effect.  Simple Block and Sub Block groupings may be created in both Effects Editors with no need of using order tools, but the pattern feature allows more advanced blocks and groupings. 6.4 Editor All fixture selections and parameter modifications occur in the Editor (also called Programmer in other consoles). The HardKeys panel, both virtual and physical, and the Smart Screen, are the most important components used to program the Editor. The Live View shows all values from both the fixtures in the Editor and the output from Controllers (also called Playbacks or Executors on other consoles). Color coding is used to distinguish between values coming from the controllers and values in the Editor. The Editor priority is always higher than the Playback priority, so any parameter moved in the Editor will overcome the values coming from any controller. Release the parameter or the fixture from the Editor to get back to the controller’s output values. 6.4.1 HardKeys The Editor Hardkeys are the buttons on the Vibe Panel use to program. Vibe is a touch-based system, allowing efficient fixture manipulation through its smart on-screen features, but it is also possible to program it in a traditional syntax based way by pressing the hardkeys in the proper sequence. As all the other panel’s physical components (buttons and controllers), also the Hardkeys may be added to the layout by using the Virtual HardKeys View. 6.4.2 Blind Editor The Blind Editor is a parallel Editor used to create or modify objects without outputting values to the stage. When using Blind Editor the [Blind] key flashes yellow and the Command Line turns yellow. In Blind Editor the syntax and operations on the Objects, such as Store and Update, can be done exactly like in the Live Editor, but with no output on stage. If a change is stored on content that is currently in Playback, then the output will be affected. Vibe has two Blind Editor behaviors: Blind acts as an independent editor, separate from the live editor. Blind grabs the values from the live editor and viceversa. This is used to emulate the behavior of single editor consoles, where the main editor output is disabled while using the Blind Editor. To open the blind editor: Press [BLIND] to open the Blind Editor empty, or as leaved at the last access. Press [VIBE] + [BLIND] to open the Blind Editor in single editor mode. The Live Editor contents are copied to the Blind Editor. To exit the blind editor: Press [BLIND] to close the Blind Editor and get back to the Live Editor. The contents in the Blind Editor are kept. Press [VIBE] + [BLIND] to exit the Blind Editor in single editor mode. The Blind Editor contents are copied and merged to the Live Editor. The contents in the Blind Editor are also kept. 6.5 Groups Groups are objects used to speed up the fixture selections, stored into the Groups Library. A Group allows to recall all the fixtures included in it by tapping on the softkey or pressing [GROUP] [#].  The order that fixtures are selected is stored in the group.. Store Groups to SKs: [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [STORE] tap desired {Group Softkey} - it does not matter if levels are set, they will be ignored. Label SK Groups: Directly after storing a group, start typing from the keyboard and a Text Entry popup will open. At any time, pressing the [TEXT] key followed by tapping the SK will open the Text Entry popup. Store Groups via keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] [GROUP] [#] [STORE]. Pressing the [TEXT] key after any Group store will open the Text Entry popup. Modify Groups using Group Settings popup: Range text labeling may be done via this method. Using keypad, press [GROUP] [#] [Settings] - the Group Settings pop-up will open. Using SKs, tap the source {GROUP} SK and then press [Settings] key. Store Groups from existent Groups: A new Group may be created from existing Groups by selecting multiple Groups using Group SKs or via keypad. Press [STORE] then tap destination {Group} SK or Press [Group] [#] [STORE] to create the new Group. The new Group will not be linked nor referenced to the original Groups. Groups may be used to release fixtures: With keypad, [GROUP] [#] [RELEASE] With SKs, {Group #} Release Release a fixture from a Group Method 1: With keypad, Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], [GROUP], #, [STORE], Group popup appears, select {Release} With SKs, Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], STORE, {Group SK}, Group popup appears, select {Release} Release a fixture from a Group Method 2: [GROUP] [#] [EDIT], [UPDATE] key flashes red ([EDIT] tap {GROUP SK} is also valid) [FIXTURE] [#] [RELEASE] Press [UPDATE] to complete the sequence To Delete a Group: With keypad, [GROUP] # [DELETE] With SKs, {GROUP} [#] [DELETE] 6.6 Grab Grab is a powerful tool for selecting fixtures that meet a number of conditions. By default [GRAB] selects all fixtures with intensity or virtual intensity values above Zero. Pressing [GRAB] without a selection opens a popup on the Smart Screen with the following options. {Filters} {Stage} - Select anything that is live on the stage and meets the conditions below. {Editor} - Select anything that is in the Editor and meets the conditions below. {Master Controller} (Playback) - Selects only fixtures on the Master Controller that meet the conditions. {Conditions} {All Fixtures} - Selects all fixtures that have any changes via the editor. {Active} - Fixture has intensity value over zero. {Invisible} - Recorded “hard” parameter values for fixtures that do NOT have an intensity value over zero. {Inactive} - Fixtures that have NO recorded values. {Parameter Selection} {All for Selected} Grabs all parameters for selected fixtures (shortcut is [VIBE] + [GRAB]) {Active (ENTER)} Select all “Active” fixtures and enters them into the Editor. (Shortcut is [GRAB] + [ENTER]) {Search &amp; Replace}. [SET] [GRAB] selects all active fixtures filtered by Set. Grab Fixtures from a Controller: Press [GRAB] - Grab Options popup will open. Press any Slider/Qkey/Aux Qkey controller button - All fixtures that are in the Controller’s active cue and have dimmer levels above Zero (or meet the Grab conditions selected in the popup) will be selected.  Pressing ENTER will put the selection in the EDITOR. Grab Fixtures in a cue based on a {Library} SK selection: Press [GRAB], tap a {Library} SK - All fixtures with matching libraries will be selected. Tap another {Library} SK - The Library will be swapped to the new library.  This is especially useful for quickly swapping colors in cues containing libraries Select all parameters for a fixture selection: Select the fixtures Press [VIBE] + [GRAB] Select all Parameters with hard and tracked values outputting to the stage: Press [GRAB] [ENTER] "],["program.html", "Chapter 7 Program 7.1 Parameters 7.2 Smart Screen 7.3 Editor Features 7.4 Live", " Chapter 7 Program This chapter deals with using the editor and the smart screen for fixture manipulation and parameter control. The following is covered in this chapter: 7.1 Parameters 7.2 Smart Screen 7.3 Editor Features 7.4 Live 7.1 Parameters Parameters are any feature of a device that may be manipulated and stored into an object. Examples of parameters are: Dimmer Pan/Tilt Cyan/Yellow/Magenta Zoom/Focus Gobo Wheel Blade Rotation To control properly any fixture, the Vibe device needs to be built according to the DMX chart of the fixture’s parameters, that is usually reported in the manufacturer’s user manual. 7.1.1 Param Banks Vibe organizes the fixtures’ parameters under 6 standard Banks and 2 special Banks: Standard Banks are: Intensity for params related to the power and rate of the light output typical parameters are Dimmer, Shutter, Strobe Position for params related to the movement and focusing typical parameters are Pan, Tilt, Move speed Color for params related to the light’s colors and tints typical parameters are Red, Green, Blue, White, Cyan Magenta, Yellow, CTC Beam for params related to the angle and size of the light beam typical parameters are Zoom, Focus, Iris, Prism Image for params related to the pictures that may be applied to the light beam typical parameters are Gobo wheel, Gobo rotation, Animation wheel Shape for params related to the framing system that cuts the light output typical parameters are Blade depth, Blade angle, Blade rotation Special Banks are: Control a param that sends “real time” messages to fixtures control functions typical functions are Lamp On, Lamp Off, Reset it is a special bank because its parameters are not stored in cues, scenes and libraries Media a bank that collects specific features to control media servers it is a special bank because its parameters are actually included in the standard banks 7.1.2 Virtual Params Vibe automatically adds to the fixtures the relevant virtual parameters, that allow controlling the corresponding real parameters in a smart and effective way. Virtual controls are also mapped to the 4 physical wheels. Virtual parameters are the following: Virtual Dimmer: assigned to fixtures that don’t have a specific dimmer parameter, usually RGB LEDs, it controls the light output intensity by adjusting the color values proportionally. Virtual HSI: assigned to fixtures with any kind of color mixing system, it’s a set of 3 params (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) that controls the color output by adjusting the real color values.  It comes particularly useful when a fixture needs to be switched with another having a completely different color mixing system, for example an CMY to an RGBA. Virtual XYZ: assigned to fixtures with Pan/Tilt parameters, it’s a set of 3 params (VX, VY, VZ) that controls the focusing by adjusting the position values. If based on a correct fixture calibration it allows to focus the fixtures on any stage point by simply tapping on the screen.  It comes particularly useful when a fixture needs to be switched with another having a different Pan and Tilt range. 7.1.3 Fixture Manipulation The manipulation of any fixture’s parameter values may be set by using either Vibe’s intuitive Smart Screen picker system or the conventional encoder wheels and the keypad method. The switch between banks can be done either from the Smart Screen or through the combination SHIFT + # where the # represents the bank number. Standard programming: Programming may be done traditionally by using {Bank} keys and the 4 large push wheels. Select the fixtures to program: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] Select the {BANK} of the parameter you wish to adjust. Banks may contain more than 4 wheels of parameters. Tap the {BANK} key or push the encoder wheel again to page to the next set of 4 parameter wheels. Select the Param to adjust either on the touch screen or by pushing the correspondent encoder wheel. The wheel display turns red. Rotate the encoder wheel of the parameter you wish to adjust, or directly add values with the keypad: Push a parameter wheel to select the parameter AT will appear on the command line Type a value from Zero ⟶ Full. **@** is only used for the dimmer, parameters other than dimmer do not use the @ key. A Parameter value must be entered in 2 digits or one digit and the [Enter] key for whole numbers: 05, 50, 5 [ENTER] = 50. Interactive programming: Programming may be done interactively by using {Bank} keys and the 4 large push wheels. Select the fixtures to program: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] Select the {BANK} of the parameter you wish to adjust OR Drag the Wheel Picker on the right side of the Smart Screen and browse to the wheel and slot you want to program. Tap the tab of the feature OR Tap the wheel slot that you wish to program. The context sensitive area on the Smart Screen will open with the appropriate picker. Adjust the virtual controls through the options shown in the picker, that will be grayed out if not available in the current fixture selection. Select multiple parameters: After making a fixture selection, toggle multiple parameters ON/OFF by tapping {Parameter Keys}, pressing encoder wheels, or toggling desired live display headers. Manipulate all parameters in a bank: After making a fixture selection, hold [SHIFT] and tap a {Parameter Bank Key}. Pressing and holding a {Parameter Bank} will popup three options: {HOME} - Sets the bank’s parameters to Home values. {ALL PARAMS} - Selects all parameters in the parameter bank. {RELEASE} - Releases the bank’s parameter from the Editor. 7.1.4 Editor Controls Dimmer Wheel is always controlling the selected fixtures’ Dimmer params, independently from the currently selected bank and parameters. Trackball is always controlling the selected fixtures’ Pan and Tilt params, independently from the currently selected bank and parameters. [PREV] / [NEXT] keys have the same functions of the Next and Prev hardkeys, but are positioned near the trackball and the dimmer wheel to make the adjustment of these params fast and comfortable. [X LOCK] / [Y LOCK] keys lock the X or Y axis of the trackball, allowing to move individually Pan or Tilt instead of both. [RES] - Sets global encoder resolution. Blue = Low 8 bit, Green = Medium 10 bit (Default) Red = Higher 12 bit. Yellow = High 16 bit. Magenta = Highest 24 bit.  Holding the [VIBE] key down while turning an encoder temporarily sets the encoder to high resolution 16 bit. Encoder Wheels the 4 interactive encoder wheels control the 4 params currently shown on the Smart Screen’s wheels display and allow to select or deselect the parameters by pushing the wheels.  Vibe uses a precision algorithm for encoders. Based on the starting resolution, the slower an encoder is turned, the more resolution it has. Extra Wheels the 4 additional interactive encoder wheels on the Smart Screen’s right side control 4 additional params, that are dependent on the bank and selected fixture type. Position, Image and Shape assign Focus and Zoom to the interactive wheels. Color assigns Color Wheels and CTC to the interactive wheels. Beam assigns Prism and Prism Rotate to the interactive wheels. 7.2 Smart Screen The 11.6” multi-touch monitor directly above the 4 encoder wheels is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying: Context sensitive interactive bank, and parameter information. Encoder wheel displays. Playback information for the controllers that are directly above it. Special popups for Libraries, Store options and Grab functions. A simplified Effects editor. Displays for Fan feature. Smart Screen is divided into sections corresponding to the Parameter Banks. The Bank buttons on the Smart Screen, used to access the different parameters of the selected fixtures, have the following behavior: Bank buttons 1-6 are always enabled. (i.e., to access libraries in the Context view) If the Bank is enabled and active (there are parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has White text. If the Bank is enabled and inactive (there are no parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has Black text. If the Bank is disabled (not functional in the current selection), it is grayed out and not accessible. If the Bank is currently selected, it has a colored background. 7.2.1 Intensity Intensity bank has parameters like Dimmer, Shutter and Strobe. The dimmer level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the predefined incremental steps. The strobe and shutter level, mode and frequency can be set in the smart screen with the macros showing the selected fixtures’ properties. Smart Screen - Intensity Bank The Context sensitive area changes depending on the bank and fixture type. Where possible, similar parameters from different fixture types will be presented to the user using Vibe’s universal fixture model. This means that is not necessary to memorize the manufacturer’s specification of each fixture, as all fixtures are programmed in a similar consistent way. 7.2.2 Position Position bank has parameters like Pan and Tilt. The fixtures’ position can be set either with the editor keys, wheels, and trackball, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the position picker. The position is calculated at the same time on Pan/Tilt values and on virtual XYZ values, based on the fixture’s calibration on the stage. Independently from the fixture’s pan and tilt range, the virtual XYZ coordinates allow easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different pan and tilt range, the XYZ values will automatically recover the positions. Smart Screen - Position Bank 7.2.3 Color Color bank has parameters like Color Mix (RGB, CMY, RGBW, …) and Color Wheels. The color level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders in “Params” screen, the color picker in “Virtual” screen, or the color presets. The color mix is calculated at the same time on the color values and on virtual HSI values, based on the fixture’s color mixing system. Independently from the fixture’s color mixing system, the color picker based on HSI system allows easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different color mixing system, the virtual HSI values will automatically recover the fixture’s colors. The color wheels are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the image picker to get complete control on the wheels’ features. The color mix can also be set by using the predefined preset combinations and Vibe’s smart features. Smart Screen - Color Bank Filters Picker Color bank has a Lee and an Other filters section to assign colors based on the most used brands of gel filters. Kelvin Picker Color bank has a Kelvin picker for a fast adjust of any color temperature between 1000K and 20000K, linearly or by incremental steps. This feature is recommended for working in television studios and photography environments. Vibe Mood Picker Color bank has a Vibe mood picker for a fast reproduction of a color taken from a picture. This feature is recommended if working with assigned color palettes, for example in cinema or theater shows, to create color libraries directly from the scene’s and costumes’ pictures. To get a color from an image: Load an image file to the Vibe mood picker Zoom the section of the target color Select the color to assign to the fixture selection  The system provides an inbuilt database of 10 default images that can be used to check the Vibe Mood Picker and create Color Libraries based on the images’ tones. 7.2.4 Beam Beam bank has parameters like Focus, Zoom, Frost and Prism. The beam parameters can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the beam picker. The beam picker automatically enables the features available on the selected fixtures, offering an intuitive control system to set the mode, speed and type of transition related to the controlled parameter. The prisms are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the wheel picker to get complete control on the prism wheels’ features. Smart Screen - Beam Bank 7.2.5 Image Image bank has parameters like Gobo and Effect wheel. The image parameters can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the image picker. The gobo wheels are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the image picker to get complete control on the wheels’ features. The image picker can be also accessed by pressing the Virtual button on image bank’s screen. On the image picker’s right side, it is possible to visualize and select each fixture’s wheel, on the left side can be set the indexing and rotation speed of the whole wheel or the single frame. The interactive wheel picker shows all the graphic frames related to the selected wheel to allow fast interchange operations. Smart Screen - Image Bank 7.2.6 Shape Shape bank has parameters like Blade movement and rotation. The blades’ depth and angle can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the blade picker. The blade picker features a smart graphic control of the blade, independently from the fixture’s blade system. Each blade can be moved, angled, and individually reset, the blade system can be rotated all together, and the reset options permit to reset the whole system or just the rotation parameter. Smart Screen - Shape Bank 7.2.7 Wheel Picker Wheel Picker is used to control any kind of wheel, such as Color, Prism, Gobo and Animation. The values will be stored into libraries, scenes and cues according to the parameter’s bank. Smart Screen - Wheel Picker The wheels adjusted with the wheel picker will reflect into values assigned to the wheel’s parameters, usually the wheel’s positioning and rotation and the whell’s frame selection, index and rotation. Any wheel of the fixtures can be controlled through the wheel picker in the same way, using the Smart Screen’s “Smart” visualization mode to visualize and select the frames’ icons directly in the right side column. 7.2.8 Control Control bank has parameters related to the fixture’s functions, like Lamp on/off and Reset. The control bank is a special bank as its parameters are not stored in cues. Instead it sends “real time” messages to fixtures control functions. Smart Screen - Control Bank 7.2.9 Media Media Bank is the picker designed for an intuitive Media Server programming, to handle media contents in a smart and easy way. In order to see the content in this bank, users will need to create Media Server fixtures such as Green Hippo’s Hippotizer. All virtual controls are also mapped to the physical wheels for easy use. This bank has 5 types of pickers: Media This picker includes a quick way to trigger media files from the media server. It shows all the folders and files inside the server and lets the user decide which one to play. By default all the folders and subfolders are visible, and once synchronizing the data with the media server through CITP the file’s thumbnails will be shown. Smart Screen - Media Bank FX (Effect) This picker includes the effects available on the media server. There are media servers with more than 1 effect engine (layer) and for each effect there will be a numbered FX Bank button. The FX Bank includes a list of effects that are possible to trigger on the server and a list of parameters to control the effect. The parameters will be dynamically changed according to the selected effect. Keystone This picker includes a graphic interface to control the keystoning of the server. There are 4 points available for movement in order to control the position of each corner of the keystone control. The selected point that is assigned to the physical wheels is marked in red. Generator This picker is specifically made for Hippotizer. On this bank, users can control the picture that is sent from the server’s layer on the Generator engine. The bank acts the same as the Media FX bank by selecting the Generator from the Generators list and then moving the Generator’s parameters accordingly. Geometry This picker includes an interface to control most of the geometric functions of the media server. There are options to control: Aspect Mode of the layer. Zoom Rotation, Indexed or Rotating with speed control Aspect Ratio Positioning, both X and Y In addition there is a graphic preview to show the approximate result of the geometric parameters. 7.2.10 Smart Settings Smart Screen’s Settings are accessed by tapping the {Settings} key. The options are divided in 3 menus: Format Resolution View The {Home} key returns menus to the upper level. Format - Sets the view format for wheel displays: Percent Decimal Text Text + Percent Resolution - Sets the wheels’ and the virtual pickers’ control resolution: 8 bit - Blue on [Res] Key 10 bit - Green on [Res] key 12 bit - Red on [Res] key 16 bit - Yellow on [Res] key 24 bit - Magenta on [Res] key  This may also be set by toggling the [Res] key over the trackball. View - Sets the behavior of the smart screen views: Auto - Shows programming display when there are fixtures in the editor, and shows the controller displays for Aux Qkeys and Global Sliders when the editor is cleared. Programming - Maintains the programming display even with the editor released. Playbacks - Maintains the playback controller display even with fixtures in the editor. Smart Screen’s Preferences are accessed by tapping the {Smart} {Param Steps} and {Extra Wheels} keys near the {Settings} key. The preferences affect the visualization display in the right side column of the smart screen: Smart - All wheels for the selected fixture are shown in the interactive wheel picker area. Parameter Steps - Pressing a parameter wheel or tapping the wheel display above it will display a picker list of all feature steps for the selected fixture. Extra Wheels - Displays wheel information for the additional context sensitive encoder wheels. 7.3 Editor Features 7.3.1 Clear To clear the last command or key pressed from the Command Line Press [CE] key To clear the Command Line without releasing the fixture selection and the param values assigned on the editor Press [VIBE] + [CLEAR] keys 7.3.2 De-Select To de-select the current Fixture Selection without releasing the param values assigned on the editor Press [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] [VIBE] + [DESEL] keys To re-select the last Fixture Selection Press [.] key 7.3.3 Release To release all the selected fixtures’ parameters from the Editor Press [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] [RELEASE] To release the entire bank of parameters of the selected fixtures from the Editor Press [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] [VIBE] + {Bank} [RELEASE] To release a fixture parameter (or the active parameters) of the selected fixtures from the Editor Press [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] {BANK} {PARAMETER} [RELEASE] If a fixture is selected and active (Red), the first press of [RELEASE] releases the parameter and then the second press releases the whole fixture. 7.3.4 Reset To reset the Editor, releasing all the param values without releasing the fixture selection Press [RESET] key To reset the Editor, releasing both the fixture selection and the param values Press [VIBE] + [RESET] keys 7.3.5 Home When a parameter is not in use, meaning it is not in the Editor, neither triggered from any Playback, the values used by Vibe to tell where the fixture parameters should be set can be based on the fixture’s home values or on the last value assigned. Vibe has two options to set uncontrolled parameters’ values, that can be set in the System Settings popup in the {Editing Properties} tab under the Default Stage Values header: {Use Home values} sets the uncontrolled parameters to their Home Value {Maintain Last Value} leaves the uncontrolled parameters to Maintain the Last Value they were at before being released All the devices have default home values for parameters based on the manufacturer’s DMX chart. Selected fixtures or parameters may be sent to their defaults using the [HOME] key. Home - Sets parameter values to home values as defined by the manufacturer or to custom values defined by the user Home Scene. The [HOME] button brings the fixture, bank or parameter home value in the Editor.

Highlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - Full Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked To Highlight Fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using keypad or using Groups. Press [H.LIGHT] - The key will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All the Fixture selection will be set as specified above. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will remain “highlighted” and all other fixtures will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [H.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. Highlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection. To swap new fixtures into Highlight: Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped. Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection. Highlight may be customized when the default home values are too generic.  Frequently users tighten the zoom or use a closer iris value as default to better focus the center of the beam. 7.3.7 Lowlight Lowlight is used when many fixtures are lit up and therefore Highlight is not helpful. Lowlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - 30% all fixtures except active fixture which will be at 100% Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked. Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked Unlike Highlight, Lowlight maintains a value of 30% for dimmers while active. To Lowlight Fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using the keypad or using Groups. Press [L.LIGHT] - The key will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will go to a dimmer value of 100% and all other fixtures dimmer values will remain at 30%. Other parameters will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [L.LIGHT] again to turn off Lowlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Lowlight the selection. To swap new fixtures into Lowlight: Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Lowlight Mode - the Lowlight selection will be swapped. Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Lowlight selection. Lowlight may be customized when the default home values are are too generic.  Frequently users set the Lowlight dimmer to Zero instead of the default 30% to create a solo effect. 7.3.8 Rem Dim Remainder Dim is an Editor Tool commonly used in theater environments but can be useful in many other situations. {REM DIM} Toggles all dimmer values to 0 except those that are selected. If no value is given in the editor, the selected fixtures will maintain their current values. Find {REM DIM} key on the toolbar when there’s a Fixture Selection active. While in {REM DIM} is ON, [Next] / [Prev] will swap the Rem Dim fixture forwards or backwards. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made followed by {REM DIM} all unselected fixtures will go to 0%. The selected fixtures will not be changed or entered into the editor. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made, [Next] / [Prev] will force all but the first fixture in the selection to 0. The next press of [Next] / [Prev] will force the first fixture to 0 and release the next fixture’s dimmer. Fixtures in the selection will continue to swap from 0 to release with each press of [Next] / [Prev]. Pressing REM DIM again toggles the feature off and restores the stage look. Cues may be stored with {REM DIM} ON and the dimmers forced to 0% by Rem Dim will not be stored. Once stored, {REM DIM} is turned off. 7.3.9 Undo Undo button directly rolls back the last actions. Every parameter programmed in the editor can come back to its previous status by pressing the UNDO button. Pressing Undo button multiple times will restore step by step the last actions. Undo function can be used to recover the editor status after a Shift + Reset command, and to restore objects that have been stored, deleted, or updated, such as groups, libraries, qlists, cues and scenes. Undo button works also with Home and High/Lowlight actions. Undo History Settings ⟶ Undo opens the Undo/Redo list to review and restore the last actions. Undo History To Undo more operations at a time, access the Undo history with the sequence [Vibe] + [Settings], [Undo] In the Undo popup’s left column are listed all the undoable actions, and in case an undo command has been done, the list on the right shows the redo able actions. Each action reports the date and time when it has been done. Select one or more actions, than press undo or redo to come back to the desired status. The popup does not close until the apply or restore buttons are pressed. 7.3.10 Fan Fan is used to apply a distribution of values to the Fixture Selection. Fan of the selected fixtures’ parameters can be done either through the keypad syntax or by using the [Fan] key and Smart Screen’s interface. To enter the Fan Mode Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode. - The key will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. Select a Curve from the Fan Mode picker on the Smart Screen’s right side. Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter. - The param’s values will be set fanned proportionally to the curve applied the order of selection. Toggle [FAN] OR Select a different parameter to turn Fan mode off. Frequently used Fan curves: {Fade In} / = lowest to highest {Fade Out}  = highest to lowest {Diagonal} -/- = Standard PAN Fan {Saw Tooth} / = Mirror lowest on ends to highest in middle {Mirror} / = Highest on ends to lowest in middle Curves can be freely changes while in Fan Mode to check the different results. Any Curve created in the Curves Editor may be applied to Fan. The Fixture Selection can be splitted to get fanned in Blocks of and Sub Blocks: Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN]. Select a Curve from the Fan Mode. Select Blocks of {#} Select Sub Blocks {#} Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode. Examples of Blocks and Sub Blocks: {Fade In} - Blocks of 1 and no Sub Block {Fade In} - Blocks of 4 no Sub Blocks {Fade In} - Blocks of 6, Sub Blocks of 2 {Saw Tooth} - (Low-High Mirror) Blocks of 12, Sub Blocks 2 Moving Light Fixture with {Fade In} Dimmer and Color Fan, and {Diagonal} Pan Fan Fixture Groups may also be used as Blocks. To Fan Blocks By Groups: Select the Groups Press [FAN]. Tap {Blocks By Group} under the Fan Mode picker. Use any of the above methods to fan parameters by Group. 7.3.11 Copy / Paste [COPY] and [PASTE] are used to make copies of any object, such as Groups, Libraries, Scenes, Cues and Qlists, and store them in the desired positions. The syntax to copy and paste an object is: {Object} [COPY] {Target} [PASTE]  [COPY] and [PASTE] keyboard syntax can be also used to copy and paste the selected (Red) params of a fixture to another. The syntax to copy and paste param values is: [Fixture] {Param Selection} or {All} [COPY] {Fixture} [PASTE] When something is in Copy the [COPY] key will flash in red to indicate there is a copied content. When a Paste command applies the content to the target, the data is kept on the Copy key to allow making other copies. Toggle [COPY] to remove the content from the copy feature. 7.3.12 Move [MOVE] is used to change position of any object, such as Groups, Libraries, Scenes, Cues and Qlists. The syntax to move an object is: [MOVE] {Object} {Target} [MOVE] can be also used to re-position Playback controllers without changing their content and settings. The syntax to Move a controller is: [MOVE] {Controller} {Target Controller} 7.4 Live Vibe has two ways to display parameter data: Live View - shows editor and playback values as a spreadsheet. Live Parameter View - shows editor and playback data in a graphic icon-based format. 7.4.1 Live View Live View Options are on the Live view’s menu.

The following is covered in this chapter: 8.1 Bank Libraries 8.2 Auto Generate 8.3 Library Defaults 8.4 Filters 8.1 Bank Libraries Libraries are the basic way to store show data on the system. The use of libraries is not mandatory, as most of the playback operations can be performed without storing any, but is highly recommended in order to make the programming flow better organized and much faster and easier, both during the setup and the editing of the show file. All kinds of libraries can be scrolled and selected through their specific softkey view or through the Context view. Vibe has two types of Libraries: Object Libraries and Bank Libraries. Object Libraries are pools of system object types, such as: Groups (used to manage fixture selection) Qlists (used to store sequences of Cues) Scenes (used to store stage looks) Snaps (used to manage controllers’ configuration) Filters (used to store Bank Libraries and Cues) Macros (used to store sequences of commands) An extensive description of each object can be found into its dedicated chapter. Bank Libraries are pools of parameter values divided by banks of parameters, such as: Intensity (dimmer, strobe, shutter, …) Position (pan, tilt, move speed, …) Color (red, cyan, CTC, color wheel, …) Beam (focus, zoom, iris, frost, prism, …) Image (gobo wheel, animation, pattern, …) Shape (blade depth, blade angle, blade rotation…) Custom (unfiltered; stores every parameter in the Editor) Effect (effects running on parameters in the Editor) Bank Libraries are often called Presets or Palettes on other consoles. Bank libraries are referenced by stored objects such as Scenes and Cues, so any modification will affect all the objects that have a reference to the edited library. Video contents, managed on the Media Bank, don’t have a specific library because Media Server’s parameters are also assigned to the previous Banks. They may be stored on the bank libraries, filtering the parameters contained in that library, either on the Custom libraries. 8.1.1 Operations Store directly to a Softkey: [Fixture] [#] [+ ⟶ -] Select parameter {Bank} on Smart Screen. Use keypad, Smart Screen pickers, and/or adjust parameter wheels, to set values. Press [STORE] - The Library {Store Options} tab will appear on top right corner of the softkeys, use the Library {Store Options} popup at the bottom on the Smart Screen to make changes.  If no option changes are required just directly tap the appropriate Library SK without tapping the Library {Store Options}. Tap destination Library softkey. Store a Library with the keypad syntax: Press [Fixture] [#] [+ ⟶ -] - Select parameter {Bank } on Smart Screen. Use Smart Screen pickers, and/or adjust parameter wheels, or type value to set values. Press [LIBRARY] - Library {Store Options} popup will open at the bottom of the Smart Screen and {Banks} will appear on the Editor Toolbar. Tap a parameter {Bank} key on the Editor Toolbar. A shortcut for Bank selection is to specify a number directly after pressing [LIBRARY] key: 1 = Intensity 2 = Position 3 = Color 4 = Beam 5 = Image 6 = Shape 7 = Custom 8 = Effect After typing the first number, the bank name will appear on the command line. The next number typed will be the library number. Enter the destination library number via the keypad. Make {Library Store Options} changes, if required. Press [STORE] to complete the sequence. Edit a Library using [UPDATE]: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage from a library referenced in an active cue or scene. Press [UPDATE] - The Update popup will open. Two columns will appear: the left column shows Cues available for updating and the right column shows Libraries available for updating. The target library or libraries should be selected. Selected libraries may be freely deselected in the Update popup. If all Libraries are deselected, updates will become “hard” values in the source cue instead of the source libraries being updated. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to close the popup and complete the update. Edit a Library using Softkey syntax: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage from a library referenced in an active cue or scene. Press [STORE] and tap source {Library SK}. The {Cancel, Update, Overwrite, Release} popup will appear on the large screen. Tap {Overwrite} to replace all fixtures with those in the Editor, {Update} to merge the editor into the library, or {Release} to remove the selected fixtures from the Library.  Releasing fixtures is only valid if the library is Fixture Specific or Device + Fixture in the case where specific fixtures have modified recorded values.  Alternatively the sequence [LIBRARY] {Bank} from the Editor Toolbar [#] [STORE] to an existing library will work the same as above. Edit Library settings: Library Settings may be changed at any time after they are created using the Library Settings popup. To open the Library Settings popup: Tap the Library {SK} you wish to modify and press [SETTINGS]. (This is invalid with Snaps and Macros as it will trigger them) OR Press [LIBRARY] tap {Bank} on the Editor Toolbar Press [#] [SETTINGS] If Reference is selected, modifying the library will modify the values of ALL cues that reference it. If Timing is selected, any parameter cell times in the Editor will be stored with the library. Rename a Library: Text labels may be assigned as library names at any time there is NOT an active selection in the Editor. Any of the following methods are valid: Directly after storing a Library, start typing on the keyboard. The Text Entry popup will appear. Tap a Library {SK}, start typing on the keyboard. The Text Entry popup will appear. Press [TEXT] tap a Library {SK}. The Text Entry popup will appear. Press [Library] tap {Bank} on the Editor Toolbar Press [#] [TEXT]. The Text Entry popup will appear. Delete a Library: Method 1: Tap the Libraries’ {SK} then press [DELETE] Method 2: Keypad sequence for Bank Libraries: [LIBRARY] tap {Bank} on the Editor Toolbar [#] [DELETE] Method 3: Keypad sequence for deleting Object Libraries: [Object] [#] [DELETE] For most Delete functions, pressing [DELETE] [DELETE] will do the same as pressing [DELETE] and [ENTER] or Apply to complete the operation. Library Softkey Menu: The Long Click gesture on any softkey, including the libraries, opens a temporary menu where the user can directly select the most used functions: Copy: make a copy of the object, that may then be pasted on a different SK Move: move the object to a different position, acting like a cut + paste command Delete: open the delete object popup Settings: open the object settings popup Text: open the rename object popup Exam: exam the object in the Exam View 8.1.2 Auto Param Grouping By default Vibe uses the concept of “Automatic Parameter Grouping” when storing libraries. When a parameter is moved, all the parameters of the same library bank are grabbed into the editor with their current status, to guarantee that what is viewed on the stage is the same as what is stored in the library. Auto Parameter Grouping can be disabled by tapping the toggle button in the system settings popup. Filters may be applied to modify what is stored in a Library. 8.1.3 Context The Context view is a softkey view that helps reducing the amount of space on the screen where the libraries are shown. Context adapts the visualization to the last selected object type or bank, for example by pressing Group it will show the Groups library, by pressing Color the Color library and by pressing Scene the Scenes library. The Context view’s settings popup on the layout editing toolbar allows to filter the contents shown by the context view. Context views can be filtered manually, by toggling the contents to enable and disable, or automatically, by setting the Smart option. Smart context setting will avoid to show the softkeys that are already shown by other softkey views on the same page. 8.2 Auto Generate The option to Auto Generate Groups and Libraries permits a smart and fast creation of the most common fixture groups and parameter libraries. The Auto Generate button is on the Editor Toolbar in Patch pages. By selecting the options in the Auto Generate popup menu, the user can configure the quantity and numbering of the libraries to be automatically created. The auto generated libraries can either overwrite or merge the already existing ones. Libraries can be named using system names or library numbers, and customized for example using the device’s name. Libraries can be numbered starting from a desired number or appended to the first available position. Libraries of different fixture types can be spaced with the desired interleave. Auto generated libraries are created when pressing the GENERATE button on the popup. It is possible to check the preferred options on each bank page and then generate all of them in a single click, as well as to generate step by step for each device or for each bank. 8.3 Library Defaults When storing Bank Libraries, filters are used to exclude parameters from unrelated banks. The Library filter defaults are set under the Filters popup, Library Defaults tab. Change Defaults: Press [VIBE] + [FILTERS] to open the Filters pop-up. Make sure the Library Defaults tab in the lower left corner of the pop-up is selected. Tap the {Library Bank} to be edited. Tap a parameter in the Available Parameters box to move it to the Filtered Parameters box. Press the {Apply} softkey to apply the filter and stay in the popup or press [ENTER] or the Apply icon to apply the filter and close the popup. Restore Defaults: - Tapping {Restore Defaults} will reset Bank Libraries to their system defaults. 8.3.1 Behavior Library behaviors are used to define which fixtures the library can be applied to. Library Bank softkeys have default filters and behaviors based on the way they are commonly used. Default library settings and behaviors can be changed in the System settings tab on the Defaults tab. Vibe bank libraries have the following behaviors: Fixture Specific (FS) – Values will be applied only to the specific stored fixtures. Parameter Specific (PR) – Values will be applied to all matched parameters. Pattern (PT) – Values will be applied to all matched parameters and will keep the pattern of values. Device + Fixture (DF) – Values will be applied to the specific fixtures when possible and the rest will be the same as the first. The first fixture will be used as a reference for all other similar fixture types. If values are changed for specific fixtures they will be stored in the library as if they were fixture specific. If a fixture other than the first fixture is released from the library, its values will again be referenced from the first fixture. If the first fixture is released, the next fixture will become the reference. Device + Parameter (DR) – Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device and having the same parameter type. Device + Pattern (DT) – Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device and will keep the pattern of values. 8.3.2 Reference When a library has the Reference option enabled, using that library will be referenced by the Cues and Scenes stored with the library active in the editor. Editing a referenced library will affect all the objects that have reference to that library. Enable or Disable library reference on the library settings or, as system default, in the system settings popup on the Defaults tab. 8.3.3 Time When a library has the Time option enabled it stores not only the parameters’ values but also the parameter times assigned in editor. Enable or Disable library time on the library settings or, as system default, in the system settings popup on the Defaults tab. 8.3.4 Effect Base When an Effect library has the reference “Include Base” option enabled, the effect will be stored together with the base values of the parameters used. Change library reference on the library settings or, as system default, in the system settings popup on the Defaults tab. 8.4 Filters 8.4.1 On the Fly On the Fly Filters are used to filter editor parameters when storing libraries, cues and scenes. The Green box indicates parameters that will be included in the cue or scene. Store using On The Fly Filters: Set or load values into the Editor. [CUE] [#] [EDIT] is also valid. Press [FILTERS] key. The On The Fly Filter popup will open. De-select banks and parameters that need to be filtered from the cue. Press [ENTER] or Apply to apply the filter and close the popup. Store library, cue or scene. Deselected banks and parameters will not be included. Options: {Select All} - Selects all banks and parameters {Deselect All} - Deselects all banks and parameters {Save as Default} - Not implemented yet. 8.4.2 Custom Filters Custom Filters may be created “blind” without a fixture and parameter selection. Filters are saved in the Filters Library and can be recalled by tapping the filter’s softkeys when storing. Parameters may be included or excluded by the Filter depending on how the filter is created. Only the parameters in the Filtered Parameters right box will be stored. All the parameters in the Available Parameters left box will be ignored. Create a Filter Press [VIBE] + [FILTERS] to open the Filters popup. Select the General Tab of the popup. Press {New}. A new filter will be created with the name {1. Filter 1}. Accept the name or type a new name in the white data entry box at the bottom of the Filter’s column. Tap in the Available Parameters box the parameters that you want to be included. The parameter will move from the Available Parameters box to the Filtered Parameters box. Tap in the Filtered Parameters box the parameters that you want to be excluded. The parameter will move from the Filtered Parameters box to the Available Parameters box. Press the {Apply} softkey to apply the filter and stay in the popup or press [ENTER] or the Apply icon to apply the filter and close the popup.

The following is covered in this chapter: 9.1 Curves 9.2 Effect Editor 9.3 Pre-Built Effects 9.4 Basic Effects 9.5 Advanced Effects 9.6 Library Effects 9.7 Effect Library 9.1 Curves Effects are built from the following components: Parameters - selected from the created fixtures’ available params. Patterns - curves that affect the fixture selection’s order. Primitives - curves that affect the parameter’s output values. The same Curves database, containing pre-built curves and user-created custom curves, is used by different features on Vibe: the Effect Engine to assign the curve to an effect the Fan Mode to set pattern curves to the parameter fanning the Address View to set specific curves to DMX addresses, such as dimmer curves All the Curves are listed in the Curves View The Curves View header has options to manage the Curves: New - to create a new curve Edit - to modify an existing curve Delete - to delete a custom curve; pre-built curves cannot be deleted Duplicate - to make a copy of an existing curve Favourite - to assign the Favourite tag to the curve, setting it in higher position on the list A Curve creation or editing will open the Curve Editor popup. Tap the graphic to add anchor points. Tap the {Remove Point} button to remove anchor points. Tap an anchor point to select and move it on the grid. Tap the {Anchor/Control} button to switch between straight and curved lines between the points. A curved line can be made on both directions and be spread with the red linked buttons. {Snap Horizontally} and {Snap Vertically} buttons fix the anchor points to the grid’s rows and columns. The Name box is to write a name for the curve. Tap Apply to store the Curve or Cancel to discard it. 9.2 Effect Editor Effects are the combination of Parameters, Patterns and Primitives. Vibe has 2 Effect Engines that provide up to 4 ways of effect building. A Basic Effect Engine opens on the Smart Screen and allows the creation of: Pre-built effects Basic effects To access the Basic Engine press the [EFFECT] button with an active fixture selection and optionally a param selection. An Advanced Effect Engine opens on the Wide Screen and allows the creation of: Advanced effects Library effects To access the Advanced Engine press the [VIBE] + [EFFECT] buttons with an active fixture selection and optionally a param selection. Once a Fixture Selection is active, the effect editors can be opened even without a parameter selection, as that can be done afterwards, directly on the effect views. This is not valid for the Basic Effects, that will be based on the Params selected at the moment that the [EFFECT] button is pressed. 9.2.1 Attributes The Effect Editor on the Smart Screen has 2 tabs available: Attributes - Used for managing Effect, Pattern and Primitive Settings. Grouping - Used for setting Blocks Of and Sub Blocks, to split the fixture selection order. Effect Settings can be applied in two modes: Relative - Changes are applied maintaining the offsets between the curves’ settings. Absolute - Changes are applied with values that are equal for all the selection. The toggle choice between Relative and Absolute can be found both in the Basic and in the Advanced Effect Engine. Effect Settings Many different Settings can be used to customize the effect’s cycle and the curves’ distribution through the fixtures and the parameters involved. The following Effect Settings affect both the Pattern and the Primitives: Offset All - Moves the start time of the Effect Event along the X axis of the Effect Track. Param Spread - Is a toggle button that enables the proportional offsetting of the start times of multiple Effect Tracks at the same time.  {Param Spread} is a quick way to make CMY or RGB effects where colors need to spread apart so as not to mix to black or white. Pattern Settings Some Effect Settings apply only to the Pattern, so they are called Pattern Settings. The Pattern is the curve that sets the order of fixture selection during its transitions across the effect. The Basic Effect Engine provides a selection of 4 Pattern possibilities: Fade In = Linear order Fade Out = Inverted order Saw Tooth = Mirrored order from sides to center Mirror = Mirrored order from center to sides The Advanced Effect Engine permits to assign any curve from the Curves database as the Pattern. The following Settings affect the Pattern: Spread - Sets the percentage of offset between each fixture in a selection. 100% would evenly divide up the selection’s transition across the Primitive, while 0% would have all fixtures transitioning in unison. UP - Based on the UP group #, each UP group will complete a full cycle across the Primitive before the next UP group can start. With a selection of 8 fixtures assigned to a sine wave curve and a spread of 100%: - if UP is set to 1, fixture 1 will have to complete its full cycle before fixture 2 will begin, - if UP is set to 2, fixture 1 and 2 will split the cycle before the next two fixtures start. Primitive Settings Some Effect Settings apply only to the Primitive, so they are called Primitive Settings. The Primitive is the curve applied to the parameter, that makes its values changing accordingly to the curve’s shape during the transitions cycle. The following Settings affect the Primitive: Time - The duration of time it takes each fixture to complete one cycle across the primitive. Size - The amplitude of the primitive’s curve, stating the param range of values. Base - The start point of the primitive, stating the starting param values. Swing - The direction from the parameters start point (Base). Swing {Up} {Center} {Down} - The keys to set the Swing at 0%, -50%, -100%. If the Base value of tilt is 50% (0°) and the Swing is Center (-50%), tilt would split center with a sine wave primitive assigned to it. Up (0%) would send the tilt from strait down to full out into the audience. Down (-100%) would send the tilt from strait down to full up upstage. 9.2.2 Grouping Grouping tab allows to split the fixture selection order. Tap the {Grouping} key - The Grouping tab will show If the Offset Pattern Spread is not above 0%, tap the {Wave On} key. The Spread will be changed to 100%. Set the {Blocks Of} [#] - This interleaves the Pattern into Groupings. The Default for Blocks and Sub Block is 1/0 - No Groupings. When {Blocks Of} is set to 1 or above, the Sub Blocks will move to 1 and Interleave Groups will be possible. 2/1 would interleave a selection into Odds/Evens. 3/1 would interleave a selection of 12 fixtures into [1+4+7+10] - [2+5+8+11] - [3+6+9+12] Set the {Sub Blocks Of} - Combines fixture in a selection, to act like single fixtures. 12/2 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12]  For Grouping to be noticeable there must be a Pattern Spread above 0%.  As a shortcut, Setting {Sub Block Of} back to 0 allows {Blocks Of} to combine fixtures instead of interleaving - 2/0 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12] Blocks by Groups is a toggle option that allows to use Vibe Groups instead of Blocks and Sub Blocks.  This feature is very useful when an effect needs to run synchronized between groups of fixtures that don’t have the same amount of fixtures. To Block by Groups, select the Groups as Fixture Selection before entering the Effect Editor.  Make sure {Sub Blocks Of} is set to 0 or the groups will act as interleave instead of blocks. 9.3 Pre-Built Effects Pre-Built Effects are the quickest and simplest way to build effects on Vibe. They are based on pre-configured Parameters, Primitives and Effect Settings. However the user can customize Pre-Built effects by editing all the available settings, using the Pre-Built library as a source to built new effects without starting from scratch. To create a Pre-Built Effect: Make a Fixture Selection: [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] Press [EFFECT] - The Smart Screen Effect Editor will open in the {Attributes} display with No Effect Events. Tap on {Pre Built} key on the right of the Smart Screen Choose the parameter Bank on the bottom of the column Tap on the desired Effect to launch it The Params and Curves involved will be loaded on the Effect Engine The Smart Screen Effects Editor allows users to quickly build effects within the normal work flow of the console while still having access to the main live displays. Effect Tracks are created for every selected parameter, but they are hidden from the view to get more space on the screen, and some advance operations are removed to speed up programming of simple effects. After programming an Effect, Close the editor using the Red X in the upper right corner. 9.4 Basic Effects Basic Effects are built by using the Basic Effect Editor on the Small Screen. A Basic Effect is obtained by applying a Pattern and a Primitive to the selected Parameters. To create a Basic Effect: Make a Fixture Selection: [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] Select the Parameter or Parameters to be involved Press [EFFECT] - The Smart Screen Effect Editor will open in the {Attributes} display with a blank Effect Event. Tap on {Curves} key on the right of the Smart Screen Tap on the desired Primitive - The Function shown on the Primitive will be loaded with a default linear Pattern. The Pattern may be changed by by tapping any of the following: / Fixtures move in a positive direction across the selection.  Fixture move in a negative direction across the selection. / Fixture are mirrored from the center. / Fixture are mirrored from the extremes. Set the Offset {Pattern Spread} - Default is 100%. 100% = Selection is divided 100% transitioning across the Primitive. 0% = all fixtures transition in unison. Set Swing Up, Center, Down, or at a specific level Adjust Size and Base to set the Low and High ranges of the values Set the Time and Rate - Rate is a multiplier of the time value. Default Effect Time is 4 seconds to complete the cycle  Similar results to inverting the pattern functions may be achieved by reversing the selection direction with the direction {⟵ Negative}, {Positive ⟶ } keys.  If more options are needed, the Advanced Effects Editor may be opened at any time by pressing [VIBE] + [EFFECTS] or the {Advanced…} key. All the Effects running in the Basic Effects Editor will be synchronized with the Advanced Effect Editor. 9.5 Advanced Effects Advanced Effects are built by using the Advanced Effect Editor on the Wide Screen, as a popup that opens over the screen’s page. Both Basic and Advanced Effect Editors work on the same Effect Engine. Whichever is opened will be synchronized between the Effects Engines, but only one Effect Editor may opened at a time. An Advanced Effect is also obtained by applying a Pattern and a Primitive to the selected Parameters, but it allows many more possibilities as it is characterized by independent and simultaneous Effect Tracks. Each Effect Track can contain many different frames, called Effect Events, with independent primitives, patterns and settings. The result of an advanced effect can be someway similar to a Timeline of effects. Effect Tracks are made up of Effect Events running horizontally. Each Track must have: At least one Parameter. Additional parameters may be added but they will respond simultaneously to the Effect. At least one Effect Event. Additional events may be added to the track each with its own time base, or they may be merged and share the same time base. Multi-track effects are effects requiring more than one parameter may be stacked on separate Effects Tracks. Examples of Multi-track effects would be: - CMY and RGB color effects - Pan/Tilt Circles - Blade effects It is possible to make simultaneous changes to Primitive, Pattern, and Effect settings by toggling them on/off. The selected elements will get a red background. The Advanced Effect Editor differs from the Basic Effect Editor in the following ways: Parameter selection is made in the Effects Editor not before entering it. Effect Tracks are shown. Multiple Parameters may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Multiple Events may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Effect sharing the same Effect Track can uses separate patterns or share patterns. Pattern Size, Rate, and Base may be spread to create randomized looking effects. Repeat allows to set the number of times each Effect Event repeats before moving on the the next Effects Event, when they are on the same Effect Track. Only a fixture selection is needed before entering the editor. Parameters are selected on the effect editor using the {Filter} and {Choose Parameter} keys. To create an Advanced Effect: Make a Fixture Selection: [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] Press [VIBE] + [EFFECT] to open the Advanced Effect Editor Select a Banks in the Filter area Select a Parameter in the Choose Parameter area - the parameter background will turn purple. Tap a blank space in the Parameter Column of an unassigned Effect Track - the parameter will be assigned to the Attributes Column. Tap a Curve from the Favorites tab or the All Curves tab - the primitive curve background will turn purple. Tap a blank space in the Effect Event Column - an Effect Event will be created with a Primitive and a Pattern. To adjust Pattern and Primitive settings, tap on them and set the options with the virtual sliders in the right area To adjust Effect settings, tap on the Track’s empty area and set the options with the virtual sliders in the right area Close the Advanced editor using the Red X in the upper right corner. Store the whole Effect directly to a cue or scene or to an Effects Library. Advanced Effects can have many Effect Events on the same Effect Track based on different parameters. Advanced Effects can have many Effect Tracks based on different parameters that will run simultaneously, but only one track per Param is allowed. Combine Parameters: Tap a parameter bank in the Filters area Tap a parameter in the Choose Parameter area - the parameter background will turn purple Tap a space in the Parameter Column already containing a parameter - the parameter will be merged into the parameter column All Primitives and Patterns will affect both parameters. Stack Effects Events: Tap a Function from the Favorites tab or All Functions tab - the Function background will turn purple Tap the space to the right of an existing Effect Even - a new Effect Event will be stacked beside the existing one Each Stacked Effect Event can have its own Primitive and Pattern. Combine Effects Events: Drag and drop the primitive of an Effect Event over an adjacent primitive - the primitives will be merged into the same event The primitives will now be combined and will share the pattern settings. Duplicate Effects Events: Tap either the pattern or primitive are of an Effect Event - the background of the pattern or primitive will turn red and the Effects Toolbar will open under the Effects Tracks. Tap {+ Duplicate} - a duplicate of the Effect Event will be added to the right of the source Effect Event Copy an Effect Track: Copies the Effect Event settings to a new parameter, this will synchronize the effect between the parameters. Tap a parameter bank in the Filters area Tap a parameter in the Choose Parameter area - the parameter background will turn purple Tap a blank space in the Parameter Column below an assigned Effect Track - the parameter will be assigned Press the empty area to the right of the source Effect Event - the blank area will turn light blue and the Effects Toolbar will open under the Effects Tracks Tap {Copy} - the source Effect Event’s settings will be copied Tap in the blank area to the right of the new parameter - the area will turn blue and the Effects Toolbar will open under the Effects Tracks Tap {Paste} - the source Effect Event settings will be pasted to the new parameter. Delete an Effect Event: Tap either the pattern or primitive of the event to be deleted - the background will turn red Tap {Delete} on the Effects Toolbar below the Effect Tracks Release a parameter from an effect: Effect Parameters may be released using Edit Cue or Update pop-up. Edit Cue  Cue must be active on a controller or it will be loaded to the Master Controller and bump its current Qlist out. [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [EDIT] - Cue values will be placed in the Editor and the [UPDATE] key will flash red. Press [VIBE] + [EFFECT] - The Advanced Effect Editor will open. Select the fixtures requiring parameters to be released. Tap the parameter or parameters in the parameter column to select the parameters - the parameters will turn purple. Tap {Release} on the Effects Toolbar - Parameters will disappear from the Effect Editor - stage values will be returned to their recorded base values or home values if they had no programmed base values. Press [UPDATE] to complete the edit and restore control to the source controller. Update  Cue being edited must be active on a controller. Select the fixtures requiring parameters to be released. Press the the parameter’s push wheel, or tap the wheel display above the wheel, to select the parameter. Press [VIBE] + [EFFECT] - opens Advanced Editor. Tap the parameter or parameters in the parameter column to select the parameters - the parameters will turn purple. Tap {Release} on the Effects Toolbar - Parameters will disappear from the Effect Editor - Stage values will be returned to their recorded base values or home values if they had no programmed base values. Press [UPDATE] - The Update popup will open. Make sure the proper cue is selected in the Cue column. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to complete the update operation. 9.6 Library Effects Library Effects are built by using the Advanced Effect Editor on the Wide Screen. Library Effects are effects between libraries that can be stored in cues and scenes as well as in the effect library and managed as a normal effects, but they keep the library references. Editing any of the reference libraries will automatically update the library effect (same as Cues and Scenes stored with library references). To create a Library Effect: Make a Fixture Selection: [FIXTURE] or [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] Press [VIBE] + [EFFECT] to open the Advanced Effect Editor Tap {Library Effects} Select a Banks in the Filter area Select a Library in the Choose Library area - the library background will turn purple. Tap the effect track to add the starting library Choose another Library in the Choose Library area Tap the right side of the effect event to add the ending library Tap a Curve from the Favorites tab or the All Curves tab - the primitive curve background will turn purple. Tap on the effect event to assign the fading curve between the libraries - an Effect Event will be created with a Primitive and a Pattern. To adjust Pattern and Primitive settings, tap on them and set the options with the virtual sliders in the right area To adjust Effect settings, tap on the Track’s empty area and set the options with the virtual sliders in the right area Close the Advanced editor using the Red X in the upper right corner. Store the whole Effect directly to a cue or scene or to an Effects Library. Same as Advanced Effects, Library Effects can have many Effect Events on the same Effect Track based on different libraries. Same as Advanced Effects, Library Effects can have many Effect Tracks based on different libraries that will run simultaneously, but only one track per Bank is allowed. An Effect can have both Advanced and Library Events, but the same parameter cannot be on more Tracks at the same time. Library Effect settings and operations are managed in the same way as Advanced Effect settings and operations are done. 9.7 Effect Library Once an effect has been created, it may be directly stored in cues and scenes or saved in Effect Libraries for future use. Effect Libraries are stored like any other Library and have a specific Effect Library Sofkey view to recall them. By Default Effect Libraries are “Parameter Specific” with disabled Reference, Timing and Base, and they filter and store all parameter types. Default Settings for Effect Libraries can be changed in System Settings popup, in the Defaults tab. Individual settings can be set on each stored Effect Library. Effect Libraries have an additional option to include or exclude the base values. Include Base is useful when effects must start from an absolute value. Effect Libraries operations are managed in the same way as all other library operations are done. "],["scene-qlist.html", "Chapter 10 Scene &amp; Qlist 10.1 Operations 10.2 Scenes 10.3 Submasters 10.4 Cues 10.5 Qlists 10.6 Chasers 10.7 Tracksheet", " Chapter 10 Scene &amp; Qlist This chapter deals with storing fixtures, parameters, libraries and times into objects to playback with the controllers: Qlists and Cues, Scenes and Submasters. The following is covered in this chapter: 10.1 Operations 10.2 Scenes 10.3 Submasters 10.4 Cues 10.5 Qlists 10.6 Chasers 10.7 Tracksheet 10.1 Operations The basic operations used to manage the programming data are common to all the objects. These operations are: Store Edit &amp; Update Delete Copy &amp; Paste Text Each operation has a dedicated command hard-key on the panel and the syntax is basically the same used for the other elements such as Groups and Libraries. 10.1.1 Store Cues and Scenes may be stored: Directly to the Master Controller Directly to a specified Qlist and Cue Directly to a controller Store the first cue directly to a controller Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [HERE] (to any of the buttons of a controller). The first available Qlist will be assigned to the controller and Cue 1 will be created. Alternatively a Cue # may be specified in advance: [STORE] [CUE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). A Qlist # may also be specified in advance: [STORE] [QLIST] [3] [CUE] [1] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). Append additional cues to a controller Set parameter values in the Editor then press the [STORE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of a controller that already has cues stored on it). A cue will be appended to the first available whole number of the Qlist. Store a Scene to a controller Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [SCENE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). The first available Scene # will be assigned to the controller. No Qlist will be assigned. Alternately a Scene # may be specified in advance. [STORE] [SCENE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). Convert a Scene into a Qlist Press [STORE] [HERE] to a Controller with an existing Scene. The Store to Controller popup will appear. Tap {Create a new Qlist} the Scene will be assigned to the first available Qlist with the Scene’s look being converted to Cue 1. Store Options In the process of storing a cue, a number of filters and settings are available. To open the Store Options popup, two methods are available: Store cues using keypad syntax Set values in the Editor. [CUE] [#] [OPTIONS] Cue Store Options popup opens. Make selections and press [STORE]. Store cues directly to a Qlist on a Controller Set Values in the Editor. Press [STORE] [OPTIONS] Cue Store Options popup opens. Make selections and press [HERE] to any button on the destination controller. Source {Red + Grey} Editor Values in 100% 90% will be stored. {Store Stage} All fixtures outputting ANY DMX from the console will be stored. This includes tracked values, home values and dimmer values at zero. {Red Only} Only Editor values in Red will be stored. This can be a useful way to filter parameters. {All Param For Selected} All parameters from the fixture selection will be turned red and stored in the cue. {All Param If Active} All parameters of all fixtures in the editor will be stored if the dimmer parameter is greater than zero. Additional {DMX In} Takes a snapshot of incoming DMX and attaches it to the cue. {Force Black} When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first “forced” to Black Out, parameters then move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. Filtering {Show Filters} Opens user prebuilt filters in the popup. Source behavior when stored: {Track} Normal system behavior {Skip Cue} Tags a cue as a skip cue in the case of inserting a new cue. In the case of updating a cue by storing to an existing cue, only the values being updated will be made into Skip cells. {Cue Only} Inserted cues will not affect the look of cues following them. Look Ahead Unlike having to Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in Cue Store Options as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just that specific cue. Force Black Tagging a cue as {Force Black} in Cue Store Options, is the same as setting the cue as {Force Black} in {Cue settings}. 10.1.2 Edit &amp; Update Modify cues using EDIT [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [EDIT] - Cue values will be placed in the Editor and the [UPDATE] key will flash red. Modify the parameters in the Editor as required. Press [UPDATE] to complete the edit and restore control to the source controller.  This method may be used in [BLIND] and unlike live, fixtures may be released from the source cue. Effects may also be edited. Modify cues using {Overwrite}, {Update}, or {Release} keys Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Press [QLIST] [#] (if not not on the Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [STORE]. If the cue exits, the Cue Exists popup will appear with options for {Cancel, Update, Overwrite, Release}. Tap {Overwrite} to replace all fixtures with those in the Editor. Tap {Update} to merge the Editor into the selected cue. Tap {Release} to remove the selected fixtures from the cue. Cue Settings popup Press [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - The Cue Settings popup will appear. Alternatively tap the {Cue #} area of the source Playback Status box to open the Cue Settings popup. Cue Settings popup is used for changing Text, Cue Time, Cue Link and Loop, Cue Re-number and Cue Tracking options at any time after the Cues are created. Update directly to a Controller Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Press [UPDATE] - The Update popup will open. Make option changes if needed. Press [HERE] to any button on a destination Controller - the Editor values will be updated into the active cue on the destination Controller. Update a cue or range of cues using keypad syntax Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Type [QLIST] [#] (if destination cue/cues are not on the Master Controller) [CUE] [+ ⟶ -] [CUE] [#] [UPDATE] - Modifications will now be updated to the destination cue selection. Update options Make a change to parameter values already outputting to the stage from an active cue or scene. Press the [UPDATE] and the Update popup will open. Two columns will appear, showing the contents available for updating. The left column shows Cues and the right column shows Libraries. If affected values are not referencing a library, the Cue column will indicate the source cue that the modifications will be updated to. Set Source Filters as required. {Master Controller} - Updates will only be made to the active cue on the controller assigned to the Master Controller. {Last Activated Controller} - Updates will be made to the last controller that asserter priority. {Grab All} - All Active Controllers will be shown in a list and the user must select the destination of the updates. Selected cues and libraries may be freely deselected in the Update popup. Set Tracking Options as required. {Default (Track)} - Changes will track forward to the next cue if it does not have a hard value. {Cue Only} - Changes will be made only to this cue, preserving the look of the next cue (Hard values will be added to the next cue). {Skip Cue} - Changes will be made to the current cue but the changes will be “skipped over” preserving the link to the original hard values. {Back Track} - Updates the changes to the original hard value that is tracked from a previous cue. If the Editor parameter values are new to the active cues or to the destination cue, the store of these values will be dependent on the Store New Values To setting: If {All Selected Objects} is selected, a list of all possible active cues will appear in the Cue column. If {Master PB Only} (controller) is selected, new values will be only be updated to the Qlist assigned as Master Controller. If {Don’t Store} is selected, no new parameter values will be updated. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to close the popup and complete the Update. 10.1.3 Delete Delete a Scene [SCENE [#] [DELETE] Optionally select other Scenes to be deleted. Press Apply or [DELETE] again. Delete a Qlist [QLIST] [#] [DELETE] Optionally select other Scenes to be deleted. Press Apply or [DELETE] again. Delete a Cue [QLIST] [#] (Optional if the controller is the Master) [CUE] [#] [DELETE] Press Apply or [DELETE] again. 10.1.4 Copy &amp; Paste Copy a Cue to a new Cue [CUE] [#] [COPY] The Copy Cue popup will open Three Options are available: {Actual Cue} - Copies cue properties as well as stored parameter values {State} - Copies all of the hard values and tracked values that make up the source cue’s “End State” (Stage look) {Values Only} - Copies only the hard values that are stored in the source cue [CUE] [#] [PASTE] - The Cue Only popup will open Three Options are available: {Track (Default)} - Creates the cue as a normal tracking cue {Cue Only} - Creates the cue as a Cue Only, converting the tracked values in hard values on the next cue {Skip Cue} - Creates the cue as a Skip Cue, preserving the tracked values on the next cues Choose an option and the operation will be completed Create a new cue using values from an existing cue Use one of the following two menu commands: [CUE] [#] {LOAD} - Loads the cue’s hard values into the Editor. Tracked values are ignored. [CUE] [#] {LOAD STATE} - Loads the cue’s hard values and the current tracked values (Stage State) into the Editor. Continue modifications and store as a new cue. 10.1.5 Text Immediately after a Store operation of any object (Group, Library, Scene, Cue, …), writing on the keyboard will automatically open the Text popup to enter the label, with no need of pressing [TEXT]. If the label has to be assigned on an already existing object, the syntax is: Select the object Press [TEXT] Enter the text and Apply Assign a Text to a Qlist Method 1 - [QLIST] [#] [TEXT] opens the Text Entry popup. Method 2 - [QLIST [#] [SETTINGS] opens the {Qlist Settings} popup. Enter Qlist Text in the white box. Method 3 - Press the Qlist header above a loaded Controller, the {Qlist Settings} popup opens. Enter Qlist Text in the white box. Assign a Text to a Cue Method 1 - [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [TEXT] opens Text Entry popup. Method 2 - If assigned to the Master Controller, [CUE] [#] [TEXT] opens Text Entry popup. Method 3 - [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] opens {Cue Properties} tab of Cue Settings popup. Enter Qlist text in the Text Box. Method 4 - [TEXT] [HERE] press any button on the destination controller. Method 5 - Press the Cue area of the display above the Controller, the {Cue Properties} popup opens. Select the desired cue. Enter cue text in the text box. Optionally notes may also be entered for the selected cue. 10.2 Scenes Scenes are essentially a QList with a single Cue. Scenes contain a single “Look” of editor values. Scenes assigned to Slider Controllers are given the default settings of: {GO + Jump Parameters} {Release At Bottom} Scenes may only be assigned Time In. Scenes may be given Text labels. 10.2.1 Scene Settings [SCENE] [#] [SETTINGS] opens the Scene Settings popup. One or more scenes can be selected from the Scene column, in order to change the SK color settings and to assign a Time-In and Text. 10.2.2 Scene Time [SCENE] [#] [TIME] opens the Scene Time popup. 10.2.3 Home Scene By default released fixtures return to their home values as defined by the device’s fixture profile. The device profile is usually based on the manufacturer’s suggested defaults, but the defaults may not be appropriate if the user prefers to set different home values. Vibe allows users to customize Home Values by building a Home Scene. When a fixture is programmed in a Home Scene it will take preference over its home values in the device profile. Store a Home Scene Program fixtures in the editor to values that will work best as home values. Press [SCENE] [HOME] [STORE] - fixtures will now use the Home Scene values when released. Update a Home Scene Program fixtures in the editor to values that will work best as home values. Press [SCENE] [HOME] [UPDATE] - fixtures will now use the Home Scene values when released. Delete a Home Scene Press [SCENE] [HOME] [DELETE] - Home values will return to the device profile’s home values. 10.2.4 Highlight Scene Store a custom Highlight Scene Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene. Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [STORE] Delete the Highlight Scene Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [DELETE] 10.2.5 Lowlight Scene Store a custom Lowlight Scene Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene. Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [STORE] Delete the Lowlight Scene Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [DELETE] 10.3 Submasters Submasters are a special type of Scene where stored fixtures limit their dimmer values proportionally to their assigned slider controller’s value. All other parameter values are ignored. Groupmasters are a special type of Submaster where stored groups of fixtures limit their dimmer values proportionally to their assigned slider controller’s value. Groups are directly assigned to controllers to create Groupmasters, that will reference the original Groups and update automatically if the Groups are modified. Both Submasters and Groupmasters can be assigned to any controller, but they get a Cyan color instead of the Yellow color that identifies Scenes. 10.3.1 Submasters Submasters are stored together with the Scenes, but they get a “SUB M” label on the soft-key. Store a Submaster Make a Fixture Selection without setting any value to the parameters. [SCENE] [#] [STORE] - The “empty” scene automatically becomes a Submaster. Convert a Scene into a Submaster Any Scene can be easily converted into a Submaster. Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any button of a controller that has a Scene assigned to it. The Controller Actions popup will appear. Tap the middle {Button}. The Choose Control drop-down menu will appear. Select the {Submaster} option with the Crown on it. The middle button mimic should now say {Submaster}. Close the popup by pressing [ENTER] or tapping Apply. The Scene will now act as Submaster on the fixtures included. The Scene’s fixture values will be ignored. Convert a Submaster into a Scene Any Submaster can be easily converted into a Scene. If the Scene used to have parameter values stored before being converted into a Submaster, reconverting the Submaster into a Scene will restore those values. If the Scene was originally stored as a Submaster, converting the Submaster into a Scene will only contain the Dimmer of the stored fixtures at Full value. Assign a Submaster directly to a Slider Controller Specify a fixture selection but do not assign editor values. Press [STORE] [SCENE] [HERE] to any button of the destination controller. The [Top Controller Button] will now turn light blue to indicate that it is now a Submaster. When the slider handle is down the [Top Button] will flash to indicate that levels are being inhibited. When it is at full the button’s blue backlight will go steady. 10.3.2 Groupmasters Groupmasters are stored together with the Scenes, but they get a “GRP M” label on the soft-key. Groupmasters work exactly like Submasters, but they are stored using existing Groups as fixture selection, and they keep the Group reference. Store a Groupmaster Make a Group Selection without setting any value to the parameters. [SCENE] [#] [STORE] - The “empty” scene automatically becomes a Groupmaster. Assign a Group to a Slider Controller using keypad syntax Press [GROUP] [#] [HERE] - To any button of the destination slider controller. The first available Scene is stored as a Groupmaster. The top controller button will turn light blue to indicate that it is now a Group Groupmaster. Assign a Group to a Slider Controller using Group softkeys Press a {GROUP} softkey and press [HERE] to any button of the destination slider controller. The first available Scene is stored as a Groupmaster. The top controller button will turn light blue to indicate that it is now a Group Groupmaster. When the slider handle is down the [Top Button] will flash to indicate that levels are being inhibited. When it is at full the button’s blue back light will go steady. 10.4 Cues Cues are single steps of a sequence, called a QList. Cue may only exist within Qlists, they cannot be stored without a Qlist destination. Cues may be numbered from 0.001 ⟶ 999.999 Cues contain a single “Look” of editor values. Single Cues can be assigned to Controllers and it will not playback the rest of the Qlist. Cues may be assigned Time In, Time Out, Delay In, Delay Out, Look Ahead, Wait, Follow. Cues may be given Text labels. 10.4.1 Cue Settings [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] opens the Cue Settings popup. One or more Qlists and Cues can be selected from the columns, in order to change their settings, time and properties. 10.4.2 Cue Time [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [TIME] opens the Cue Time popup. The Cue Time popup is used to set the timing properties of the Cue: Time In Time Out Delay In Delay Out Wait Time Follow Time Look Ahead Time Assign a {Time In/Out} to a Cue Press [CUE] [#] Press [TIME], the Time popup will appear Enter a value with the keypad. The default unit of time will be seconds. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to exit the popup and assign the cue time. Assign a separate {Time In} {Time Out}, and/or {Delay In} {Delay Out} times to a Cue Press [CUE] [#] Press [TIME], the Time pop-up will appear. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Time In}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Time Out}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay In}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay Out}. Alternatively times can be directly entered on the Cue Time popup by tapping the desired time field and making a keypad entry or turning the virtual wheel. Out times only apply to dimmer parameters. Wait and Follow Times There are two ways to make a cue automatically follow another: Wait Time - Starts counting down from the [GO] press before the next cue is executed. Follow Time - Starts counting down upon completion of the current cue time and all of its individual parameter times. Set a Wait Time Select the cue you want the Wait to be executed from. Press [TIME] - the Time popup will appear. Tap {Wait} and either type in the Wait Time or use the virtual time wheel to set the Wait Time. To clear a Wait Time, turn the Wait Wheel until the {Wait} display writes N/A, press [ENTER] Set a Follow Time Select the cue you want the Follow to be executed from. Press [TIME] - the Time popup will appear. Tap {Follow} and either type in the Follow Time or use the virtual time wheel to set the Follow Time. To clear a Follow, turn the Follow Wheel until the {Follow} display writes N/A, press [ENTER] 10.4.3 Param Time Param Time, also known as Cell Time, is a Time and Delay assigned to a specific selection of parameters. Param Times can be stored in Scenes and Cues, as well as in Libraries. The Param Times have priority over Cue Times; if any value of a fixture’s parameter has a Param Time assigned, it will fade in the param time instead of the Cue Time. Each parameter cell can have its own individual time which overrides overall cue time. This allows, for example, Pan/Tilt to have a separate transition time or Color Wheels to snap to their values instead of using overall cue time. Open the Param Time popup by pressing [TIME] after selecting any fixture in the Editor. If one or more Params of the fixture selection are active in the Editor, the Time popup will show their columns already selected. The time cells’ background is Blue, Red or White according to the Editor state of the parameter. Assign Parameter Time during Cue Creation Set fixture parameter values in the Editor. Select the fixtures requiring Parameter Time. Press [TIME] - The Parameter Time popup will appear. Toggle on/off the parameters requiring Parameter Time Parameter view may be filtered by banks. Fixtures may be selected and detected freely in the popup. Toggling the parameter header will reselect all fixtures. Set the parameter time for the selected fixtures directly using the keypad, or by using the virtual or physical time wheels. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup. Selected fixtures will now show a clock icon in the Live View. Store the Cue.

Toggle on/of the parameters that require parameter or delay time. Tap the Time-In or Delay-In virtual wheel. Type a time or delay range. To evenly fan delay-in time for tilt in a selection of 8 fixtures, Tap {Delay-In} wheel and then 0 → 8 seconds on the keypad. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the Parameter Time popup. Press [UPDATE] - Check that the correct cue is selected. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the Update popup. The above sequence will also work with [CUE] [#] [EDIT] but step 8 is redundant. Method 3: The following command combination enables a cell time fan without the need to touch the screen and set the time with the wheel. Select Fixtures Give values to a parameter Press Time Popup opens Press #→# and ENTER The first number is the base for the fan and the second number is the end value of the fan. In the picture below there is a fan between 2 and 6 seconds on the Tilt parameter. 10.4.4 Param Profile Profile determine a parameter’s behavior during a fade. Profiles are always relative to the fade time. Profile options are available in a popup that is triggered from a button on the toolbar named Profile. This button is valid once there is a valid parameter selection. Profile examples: Linear (default) – on go, the parameter fades in cue time to its new level Jump on Start (One) – on go, the parameter jumps to its level Jump on End – when the fade is complete, the parameter jumps to its new level Jump on 50% (Step) – when the fade reaches 50% of the cue time, the parameter jumps to its new level Any function from the system functions can be applied as a profile. Set a Parameter Profile Select fixtures Select parameter(s) On the Editor Toolbar tap Profile Popup opens On the left side there is a list of active parameters in the editor. Colored are the parameters that the settings will be applied to. User can switch a parameter on or off. In the middle there is a list of functions. User may select the desired function as the profile for the parameters. On the right side there are options that can be changed and explained in the table below. User may apply the popup with nothing selected on the options or with all the options active. 10.4.5 Virtual Param Fade As described in the Program section, the fixtures may be manipulated physically, by assigning a value to the target parameter, or virtually, by assigning a value to the virtual parameter that will be translated by the system to the fixture’s real parameter. The Virtual Parameters are: Virtual Color Mix - HSI system (V-Hue, V-Saturation, V-Intensity) Virtual Position - XYZ coordinates (Vx, Vy, Vz) By default the fade between Cues is considering the transition between the physical parameters, but the option can be switched for each Cue, in the Cue Settings popup, to set a fade between the virtual parameters. A Color Fade using Virtual HUE parameters allows to fade between different color mixes without changing the Saturation, by only moving the Hue value, or to fade only the Saturation (or the Intensity) without changing the tone of the color. The Vibe will automatically manage the timing to set to each of the colors involved to get the fade as programmed. A Position Fade using Virtual XYZ coordinates allows to fade between different positions moving on a straight line, for example only on the X axis or on the y axes of the stage, without calculating the curve that physical Pan and Tilt values should be faded to get that result. The Vibe will automatically manage the timing to set the Pan and Tilt fades to get the fade as programmed, basing on a proper fixture calibration that allows the system to know the stage size and the fixture positioning. 10.5 Qlists Qlists are containers that hold Cues. Each Qlist has its own unique Cue numbering system. Qlists contain a sequence of Cues in a specified order. Each Qlist may have up to 8,000 cues. Qlists containing Cues must be assigned to Controllers to output to the stage. Every Qlist can be assigned to many different controllers at the same time, and played back individually. The playback options of a Qlist are a combination of the general Qlist Settings and the Cue Settings of the internal Cues. Qlists may be given Text labels. 10.5.1 Qlist Settings Qlist Settings can be stored in two ways: either to the Qlist itself or to the Controller that currently has the Qlist assigned. [QLIST] [#] [SETTINGS] Opens the Qlist Settings popup, to store the settings directly to the Qlist. Tap on the Qlist name on the top of the Playback Status box, or [SETTINGS] [CONTROLLER] Opens the Controller Settings with the Qlist Settings Tab, to store the settings only to the specific controller. In this case the Store to Qlist button may be enabled to store the settings to the Qlist as well. The Restore default button rolls back the changed settings to the default ones. {Qlist Mode} - Defines if the Qlist will play normally or as a Chaser. {Qlist Direction} - May be used to invert the playback order. {Tracking} - Enables or disables the Tracking on the specific Qlist for further Cue store operations. It won’t affect the already stored Cues. {Preferences} - Defines the general behavior of the Qlist. {Back to Top} Sets the Qlist to restart from the first Cue when it is release. {Sequence} Enables or Disables the Cues’ sequence. A Qlist assigned to a controller has the Sequence enabled while a single Cue has the Sequence disabled. {Mark Cue at the Top} Inserts a Mark Cue before the first Cue to preposition the parameters. {Loop Back to First} If enabled, a GO command to the last Cue will fade to the first Cue, making the Qlist a loop. {Trigger} Enables or Disables the activation of elements stored to the Cues, such as Macros. {Look Ahead} Enables or Disables the Look Ahead to move in dark the parameters. {Loop Go Behaviour} - Defines the behavior of the Qlist. A short explanation of the selected behavior is given at the bottom of the area. {Release Time} - Defines a time that the Qlist will use when it is released. Other relevant settings that may affect the behavior of a Qlist can be set to specific target Cues, so they can be found in the Cue Settings popup. Cue Settings popup can be opened with [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] or by tapping on the Cue name on the left side of the Playback Status box. 10.5.2 Tracking Vibe uses the Tracking philosophy common in most current lighting consoles. In tracking consoles, “Hard Values” (parameter values with stored information) track forward from cue to cue until new hard values are encountered. Tracking systems have two kinds of parameter value cells: “Hard Value” Cells are values actually stored in the Cues, “Tracked Value” Cells get values by the original hard values stored in the previous Cues. If the user prefers to use the Non Tracking philosophy, it is possible to switch the mode in System Settings. For programming in Non Tracking, it is suggested to apply the Compulite Mode to set a few options that help managing the workflow. The Tracking method is more efficient, because only hard values are stored in a Cue while the values that are not supposed to change are taken from the previous Cues, making the total amount of stored data much lighter. Oppositely the Non Tracking method stores hard values in each Cue, so if a parameter value is not changing for many sequential Cues, it will anyway be stored in each Cue, making the whole amount of store data much heavier. Vibe’s default behavior for parameters it LTP (The last action takes precedent), a cell assigned its own time will continue to run its time until either the stored time runs out or it encounters a new hard value. An advantage of tracking is that it makes it faster the update of values through many consecutive Cues. If values are tracking through a number of cues, by changing the original hard values the information will change for all the Cues down to the next hard value, with no need to copy the changes to each cue. An issue with tracking is that making a modification to values in one of the cues in the tracked range will change the values in all the cues following it. Vibe offers smart options to manage the Cue editing process and avoid tracking values when they are not needed. These options that can be assigned independently to each single Cue of a Qlist, are listed in the Cue Settings popup. Individual cues may be tagged with one of the following Tracking Options Cue Only - Removes tracked values from asserting to the stage and sets them at home values (Not to be confused with Cue Only used with [UPDATE] which works on a cell basis). {Cue Only} is used in any case where cue editing, cue insertion, or cue deletion must affect “This Cue Only”. The look of the cue following any of the above operations will maintain the appearance it had before the operation. This is done by automatically copying the hard values that made up the original look (stage state) and pasting them into the cue following the modification. The downside is that there is no longer a tracking link from the original hard values even though the values match the original values. Skip Cue - All cells in the cue will behave like Skip Cells. Values will still “skip around” a Skip Cue, even if the values in the Skip Cue are modified. {Skip Cue} stores modified values as a special kind of cell that acts like a normal Tracking Cell until the Skip Cell is reached. The Skip Cell behaves as if it has hard values and outputs its value to the stage, but when the Qlist is advanced past a cue with the Skip Cells they again behave as tracking cells, thus restoring the link to the original hard values.  Storing a Cue modification using Skip Cue, has the same apparent result as storing Cue Only. The main difference is that with Cue Only the link to the original hard values is lost, while with Skip Cue the link is preserved. To make it easier for users to identify cues with Skip Cells, the parameter value with the Skip will be displayed in Magenta. In live playback view, cues that are set as Skip Cues have a Magenta color. Block Cue - All cue parameter values whether tracked or hard will be made to act like hard values. Any new values added to cues above the Block cue will not track past a cue tagged as a Block. {Block Cue} acts like a stopper for the tracking values, but it doesn’t need to contain all hard values as it will avoid the tracking also on the values that are not store but are there because are tracked from previous cues. In live playback view, cues that are set as Block Cues have a Blue color. Default (Track) - The systems default behavior. {Track Cue} will get the values tracked from the previous cues, modify only the hard values that are stored in it, then track all the values to the following cues. 10.5.3 Move in Dark There are 2 conditions when a fixture may be wanted to move in dark, with the light not visible, to preposition the parameters without showing the changes until they are completed. The fixture’s Dimmer is ON, so any parameter movement will be visible. The only way to hide the changes is to temporarily shut down the light output, then moving the parameters, then reopening the Dimmer. In this situation Vibe uses the Force Black Cue. The fixture’s Dimmer is OFF, but the parameters are changing in the next cue while the Dimmer is reopening, so the light output is going to make the movements visible. Then the user would like the fixture to preposition the parameters that are going to be different in the next Cue before it starts fading, while the Dimmer is still at 0%. In this situation Vibe uses the Look Ahead. Force Black Force Black is an additional Cue Setting that any cue can be individually tagged with. Use Force Black when it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another. Force Black Cues may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first “forced” to Black Out, parameters then move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. Store a cue as a Force Black [QLIST] [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] Toggle {Force Black} On - The indicator will turn green and the cue will be flagged as a Force Black cue. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup. Remove a Force Black [QLIST] [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS]. Toggle {Force Black} Off - The indicator will turn off and the cue will no longer act as a Force Black cue. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup. Look Ahead Look Ahead is a Qlist Property that needs to be set on the Qlist or Controller and on the Fixtures or Parameters, by including them into a Look Ahead Mask. Look Ahead feature is used for automatic pre-positioning of selected parameters when the fixture’s dimmer is dark, thus avoiding visible parameter movement. For Look Ahead to work, the fixture’s dimmer must be at 0% and there must be a parameter move from the current cue to the next cue. Look Ahead fades can be set for a specified default time or user time, which can be different from the cue’s default fade time. Before using Look Ahead, a Look Ahead mask must be created. The Look Ahead mask tells which spots, or spot parameters, are affected by the Look Ahead feature. If no parameters have been specified in the Look Ahead mask, all the fixtures’ parameters will be affected. Currently the Look Ahead pre-positioning will happen at the last available opportunity before the dimmer turns on.  If in specific cues you want to prevent applying the Look Ahead mask, give dimmers a value of 1%. Fixtures without physical dimmer parameters should not be included in the Look Ahead Mask. Enable or Disable Look Ahead on all controllers Open System Settings from the Vibe Menu or tap the status area of the main monitor - The System Settings popup will open. Tap the {Timing} tab to open the Timing Properties popup. Under the Look Ahead header enable or disable all controllers using {Set All Controllers ON} or {Set All Controllers OFF}. There is no confirmation of On/Off as these buttons basically toggle {Look Ahead} in all Qlist Settings popups. If Look Ahead is globally turned off it may still be enabled on a per Qlist basis in the Qlist Settings popup. Look Ahead status for individual controllers may be viewed in the controller’s Qlist Settings. Store a Look Ahead Mask Select the fixtures to be in the Mask. Optionally select the parameters to be included in the Mask - If no parameters are selected, all parameters will be included. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [STORE]. Delete a Look Ahead Mask Select the fixtures to be deleted from the Mask. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [DELETE]. Set Look Ahead Time Set the speed at which fixtures move in dark, individually on each Cue. Cues without a specific Look Ahead Time assigned will use the default Look Ahead Time. [CUE] [#] [TIME] - The Time popup will open. Tap {Look Ahead} - The indicator will turn green and Look Ahead will appear over the virtual time wheel. Set the time value using the virtual wheel or type the value directly on the keypad. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup and store the Look Ahead time. Look Ahead time can also be changed using the [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] command. Default Look Ahead time can be set in System Settings/Defaults/Cue Settings. Enable or Disable Look Ahead on individual controllers Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button of the controller you wish to enable or disable Look Ahead on - The Settings popup will open. Tap the {Qlist properties} tab - The Qlist Properties popup will open. Toggle Look Ahead on or off. Press [ENTER] or Apply to close the popup. 10.5.4 Link Link is a feature that allows to create a link between two not consecutive Cues, so that a Go command to the first Cue will fade to the linked Cue instead of the following Cue. A common sample of using the Link is when a show is programmed on a main Qlist, and for a temporary cause a part of the scenes has to be ignored without deleting them (maybe an actor is missing and his part of the show will not be performed this time, but it will be performed again on the next dates of the tour, as soon as he comes back). The Link allows to connect the Cue before the “missing part” to the cue that follows it, without losing the data contained in the “jumped” cues. When removing the Link the cues in between will be restored. Cues may be linked using the Link popup.  In cue sheet, cues that are disabled because of a Link are grayed out. Cues may be linked out of sequence using the following methods: Link with keypad and Toolbar Source [CUE] [#] {LINK} on the Editor Toolbar - The Link popup will appear. Type link destination [#] (Do not press [CUE]). Press Enter or Apply to complete the operation. Link with Cue Settings Source [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - Cue Settings popup will open. Tap {Link} - The Link popup will appear. Type, scroll or drag to the desired destination cue. Press Enter or Apply to complete the operation. Press Enter or Apply again to close the Settings popup. Remove a Link with keypad and Toolbar Select the source [CUE] [#] and tap {Link} on the Editor Toolbar, the Link popup will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the link. Remove a Link with Cue Settings Select the source cue and open the Link popup by any of the above methods. If the proper source cue has been selected, the {Unlink} key will appear. Tap {Unlink} key to remove the Link.  If the source cue is forgotten, check the Link # field in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet. 10.5.5 Loop In many consoles the only way to create a loop is to create a link from the end of a range of cues back to the beginning. Follow time must then be assigned to all of the cues. In Vibe this is also possible, but a shorter more efficient method is also provided. Loop function is an evolution of the Link function, and it can be also assigned either with the keypad and Toolbar or with the Cue Settings popup. Cues may be looped using the Loop popup. In live playback view, cues that are set as Loop Cues have an orange color. Cues may be looped using the following methods: Loop with keypad and Toolbar Start [CUE] [#] tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop popup will appear. Type end [#] or use {To Cue No} field list to select the end cue. Press Enter or Apply to complete the operation. Loop with Cue Setting Start [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - Cue Settings popup will open. Tap {Loop} - Loop popup will appear. Type end Cue [#] or scroll the value picker to the desired end cue [#]. Press Enter or Apply to complete the operation. Press Enter or Apply again to close the Settings popup. Loop Count Loop Count define the number of times that a loop is running before stopping at the end of the loop. The Loop Count may be assigned using any of the above methods to open the Loop popup. Make sure {Auto Loop} is selected. Under the {# Of Time To Loop} field, Type loop count number or scroll the value picker to the desired loop count number. Press Enter or tap apply to complete the operation. Auto Follow Loop Auto Follow loops advance to the cue following the loop, after completion of the loop count. Toggle {Auto Follow} - On/Off as required. Set a Loop as Manual Loop A Manual Loop is a Loop that does not advance automatically. Toggle {Auto Loop} - Off Remove a Loop with keypad and Toolbar The Qlist must be released first. Select the start [CUE] [#] and tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop popup will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the loop. Remove a Loop with Cue Settings The Qlist must be released first. Select the start cue and open the Loop popup by any of the above methods. If the proper start cue has been selected, the {Unloop} key will appear. Tap the {Unloop} key to remove the Link. Press Enter or tap Apply to complete the operation. 10.6 Chasers Chasers are Qlists that playback Cues following the Chaser timing. Chasers ignore the Cues’ times and run a loop based on the Chaser Time. Chasers contain a sequence of Cues in a specified order. Each Chaser may have up to 8,000 cues. Chasers containing Cues must be assigned to Controllers to output to the stage. Every Chaser can be assigned to many different controllers at the same time, and played back individually. The playback options of a Chaser are a combination of the general Chase Settings and the Cue Settings of the internal Cues. Chasers may be given Text labels. 10.6.1 Chase Settings Chase Settings can be stored in two ways: either to the Qlist itself or to the Controller that currently has the Qlist assigned. [QLIST] [#] [SETTINGS] Opens the Qlist Settings popup, to store the settings directly to the Qlist. Tap on the Qlist name on the top of the Playback Status box, or [SETTINGS] [CONTROLLER] Opens the Controller Settings with the Qlist Settings Tab, to store the settings only to the specific controller. In this case the Store to Qlist button may be enabled to store the settings to the Qlist as well. In the Qlist Settings popup, set the Qlist Mode to Chaser and tap on the Chase Settings tab to set the settings of the chaser. The Restore default button rolls back the changed settings to the default ones. {Chaser Mode} - Defines if the Chaser Time will be controlled by the Rate or by BPM. {Rate} - The multiplier of the chase timing, based on the Qlist whole timing. {BPM} - The timing is set by beats per minute, enabling the Time BPM wheel. {Chase Pattern} - Defines the Cues order of the chaser. {Normal} - The Cues’ are played individually, the sequence is played forwards in the stored order and the last Cue loops to the first Cue. {Build} - The Cues’ are played one on top of the previous, the sequence is played forwards in the stored order and the last Cue loops to the first Cue. {Bounce} - The Cues’ are played individually, the sequence is played forwards in the stored order until the last Cue and then backwards until the first Cue. {Bounce Build} - The Cues’ are played one on top of the previous, the sequence is played forwards in the stored order until the last Cue and then backwards until the first Cue. {Random} - The Cues’ are played individually, the sequence is played in random order. {Time} - If the Chaser Mode is set on BPM, the Time wheel sets the number of BPM. Default time is 30 bpm. {Loop Count} - Defines the number of loops of the chaser. If the Loop Count is 0 the number of loops will be infinite. {Properties} {Int Limit} - Sets a limit to the intensity parameters. {X-fade} - Sets the crossfade time between the cues from 0% to 100%. 10.7 Tracksheet The Tracksheet view shows the parameter values of the sequence of Cues inside a Qlist. Qlist Tracksheet is used to check if the values played back by a Cue are stored as hard-values or are tracked from previous Cues. The Tracksheet can be also used to directly adjust and update the Cues. Each line represents a Cue, each column represents a parameter of a fixture stored in the Qlist. Empty cells show that the param has no value on that Cue. Colored text cells show the param value, defined by the following color coding: {Cyan} - The value is stored in the Cue. {Blue} - The value is stored and it is higher than the previous Cue. {Green} - The value is stored and it is lower than the previous Cue. {Red} - The value is stored and it is the same as the previous Cue. {Violet} - The value is not stored in the Cue, but it is tracked from a previous Cue. 10.7.1 Menu and Filters The view’s menu contains some filters and actions that can be applied to the tracksheet view. {Qlist} - The top button of the Menu is used to navigate and load the Qlists. Only one Qlist can be shown at a time. The loaded Qlist number and name are shown here. {Bank Filter} - Filters the data shown on the view by parameter Bank. {Set} - Filters the fixtures shown on the view by Set. {Selection Filter} - Shows on the view only the currently selected fixtures. {Refresh} - Refreshes the view in case changes have been done while a Qlist is loaded. {Format} - Defines the data to be shown on the cell, such as the value in %, Decimal, Text, Text+%, or the Cell Time. {Column Limit} - Sets a limit of columns shown. Set a lower limit to load the view faster. 10.7.2 Update Actions Update Cues with Tracksheet The values stored inside each Cue can be directly edited into the tracksheet view. To avoid tracking conflicts, a single Cue can be edited at a time. To modify any value, tap on the cell and enter the new value with the numeric keyboard, then press Enter or tap outside the selected Cue’s line and it will get a white background (Cue Edit Mode). The edited params will be colored in Red. When a line is in Cue Edit Mode, the Tracksheet Actions will appear on the view’s Menu: {UPDATE} - Updates the Cue with the edited values. {Tracking Options} - Defines if the update operation will be Track, Skip or Cue Only. {Backward Track} - Enables the BackTrack, updating the edited values in the origin tracking Cue instead of the currently selected Cue. {Library Track} - Enables the tracking of the library reference instead of using the hard value without references. {Clear Changes} - Restores the Cue without updating the edited values. "],["playback.html", "Chapter 11 Playback 11.1 Physical Controllers 11.2 Virtual Controllers 11.3 Controller Keys 11.4 Controller Configuration 11.5 Live Controller 11.6 Teach Rate", " Chapter 11 Playback This chapter deals with the assignment of Qlists and Scenes to the Controllers and the management of playback settings. The following is covered in this chapter: 11.1 Physical Controllers 11.2 Virtual Controllers 11.3 Controller Keys 11.4 Controller Configuration 11.5 Live Controller 11.6 Teach Rate 11.1 Physical Controllers Playback is done with Controllers, that can be both physical or virtual. Controllers are divided into different types, characterized by the quantity of buttons, faders and knobs available. Vibe has five controller types, with the following quantities and numbering: A/B Crossfader: Non-Motorized pair of Sliders with dipless crossfade and Two buttons 1 Non-motorized A/B dipless crossfader - Numbered 401 Slider: Motorized Slider Controllers with Three buttons 30 pages of 100 Motorized Sliders - Numbered 1.1 ⟶ 30.100 Qkey: Pressable knob or Single button Controllers 30 pages of 100 Qkeys - Numbered 1.101 ⟶ 30.200 AuxKey: Single button Controllers 30 pages of 100 Auxkeys - Numbered 1.201 ⟶ 30.300 Global Slider: Non-Motorized Slider Controllers 100 Non-motorized Global Sliders - Numbered 301 ⟶ 400  Controllers are numbered from right to left to facilitate continuous numbering with physical and virtual controller wings. Controllers are used to playback or execute a number of stored objects: Qlists and Cues Chasers Scenes Submasters Groupmasters Libraries Macros The following samples explain how to assign a Qlist to any controller, but the syntax to assign any other stored object is the same. Assign a Qlist to a Controller: [QLIST] [#] OR Object Softkey [HERE] to any button of the target controller.  Blank Qlists may also be assigned to any controller.  If a non existing Qlist is assigned, it will be created. Assign a range of Qlists to consecutive Controllers: [QLIST] [#] → [QLIST] [#] [HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the first of the range. Assign a Single Cue to a controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [HERE] to any button of the target controller. Controller Color Codes The objects assigned to any controller are identified by the Controller Color Codes, that are referred to the physical buttons’ LEDs and to the virtual controllers’ background. Controller color coding from [SELECT] Master Controller: Cyan = Initial Hard Value Blue = Hard Value Changing Upward Green = Hard Value Changing Downward Purple = Tracked Value Red = Redundant Block (may be released with {Unblock}) Magenta = Skip Value Controller color coding from non-[SELECT] Master Controller: Yellow = Output from a Qlist, Cue, Scene Submaster or Group Master = Controller Display and Backlit Controller Key’s color coding: Top Button: Dim White = Unloaded White = Loaded Green = Qlist, Cue Active Red = Chaser Active Yellow = Scene Active Blue = Sub or Group Master @ FL Any of above Flashing = In Progress Middle Button: Dim White = Unloaded White = Loaded Blue = Select (Master Controller) Flashing Red = Back Flashing Yellow = Pause Bottom Button: Dim White = Unloaded White = Loaded Blue = Select (Master Controller) 11.1.1 Grand Master + BlackOut The main controllers of the console are the Grand Master, or GM, and the BlackOut, or B.O. The Grand Master proportionally limits the output values of all the DMX addresses that have a Dimmer parameter patched. The BlackOut toggles at Full or Zero the output values of all the DMX addresses that have a Dimmer parameter patched. The Grand Master slider and the BlackOut button are the only “special” controllers that cannot be customized; their functions cannot be changed and they cannot have any object assignment. The Grand Master slider and the BlackOut button have priority over the whole system, including all the Playback controllers and also the Editor. 11.1.2 A/B CrossFader The Manual Crossfader set is a controller with 2 non-motorized sliders and 2 buttons. The default action of the right button is Go The default action of the left button is Hold/Back The A/B CrossFader Pair is provided for manual “Theater Style” playback of cues. By default the fader on the left will control dimmer parameters fading in. By default the fader on the right will control all other values, including the dimmer that are fading out. Parameter values that match will not dip even if the A and B are at different levels. The A/B Controller Actions popup allows to set if the sliders’ behaviour should be Splitted (Separated) or Merged (In/Out). 11.1.3 Slider The Slider set is a controller with 1 motorized slider and 3 buttons. When a Qlist is assigned: By default the fader will control intensity parameters The default action of the top button is Go The default action of the mid button is Hold/Back The default action of the bottom button is Flash When a Scene is assigned: By default the fader will control all parameters The default action of the top button is Go The default action of the mid button is Hold/Back The default action of the bottom button is Flash When a Submaster is assigned: By default the fader will act as a submaster The default action of the top button is Group Select The default action of the mid button is Group Deselect The default action of the bottom button is Flash 11.1.4 Qkey The Qkey set is a controller with 1 knob or slider (virtual only) and 1 single button. When a Qlist is assigned: By default the knob will control intensity parameters The default action of the button is Go When a Scene is assigned: By default the knob will control all parameters The default action of the button is Go/Release When a Submaster is assigned: By default the knob will act as a submaster The default action of the button is Group Select 11.1.5 AuxKey The Auxkey set is a controller with 1 slider (virtual only) and 1 single button. When a Qlist is assigned: By default the knob will control intensity parameters The default action of the button is Go When a Scene is assigned: By default the knob will control all parameters The default action of the button is Go/Release When a Submaster is assigned: By default the knob will act as a submaster The default action of the button is Group Select 11.1.6 Global Slider The Global Slider set is a controller with 1 non-motorized slider and 1 button. When a Qlist is assigned: By default the fader will control intensity parameters The default action of the button is Go When a Scene is assigned: By default the fader will control all parameters The default action of the button is Go When a Submaster is assigned: By default the fader will act as a submaster The default action of the button is Group Select 11.2 Virtual Controllers All the controllers can be added on the layout as Virtual Controllers. Any controller can be both physical and virtual, and the list of all the Virtual Controller Views available can be found in the Playback Views submenus. Virtual Controllers may be added as a single part (fader or button), as complete set, or in sets of 5 consecutive controllers. The Virtual Controllers may be added to the Vibe Layout, moved, assigned and resized as preferred. Vibe software makes no distinction between physical and virtual controllers, this allows the system hardware to be virtually scaled. 11.2.1 Grand Master + BlackOut Open the virtual Grand Master with [SHIFT] + [B.O.] In this view the Grand Master level can be set, it can be Disabled, and it also can be set to operate on a user-defined range, from 0%-100% to 0%-200%. The Proportional Grand Master Level can be used for example in touring productions, where the rehearsal and the lighting programming may be done in a medium-sized venue for a show that will be performed both in smaller and bigger stages. Setting the G.M. at 100% with a level range up to 200% will allow the operator to keep enough margin to light up the bigger venues without need to add more fixtures. The Disable GM button completely inhibits the Grand Master, while it is possibly to exclude form the Grand Master just specific DMX addresses. This is done via the Address View by editing the Address Properties. A Virtual BlackOut button can be added to the layout by selecting it from the Single Button popup into the Program Views menu. 11.2.2 A/B Crossfader The Virtual A/B Crossfader has a Locker between the sliders used to set if the sliders’ behaviour should be Splitted (Separated) or Merged (In/Out). 11.2.3 Slider Virtual Sliders show the controller’s page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders. 11.2.4 Qkeys Qkeys can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller’s hardware (single button or knob). Virtual QKeys show the controller’s page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders. 11.2.5 Auxkey Auxkeys can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller’s hardware (single button). Virtual AuxKeys show the controller’s page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders. 11.2.6 Global Slider Global Sliders can have a virtual button and a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button, independently from the corresponding physical controller’s hardware (the physical global sliders are only on the main Vibe console, but the virtual global sliders can be added to any layout). Virtual Global Sliders show the controller’s page and number, the name and number of the content loaded, the current and next Cue name and number, the fader level, and the icons of the functions assigned to the buttons and faders. 11.3 Controller Keys 11.3.1 Master Keys The Master Controller is the main controller to which the Master Keys and the syntax shortcuts are referred to. One of the controllers is always assigned as the Master Controller. Not more than one controller can be assigned as the Master Controller at the same time. Any Controller may become the Master Controller at any time. To assign a controller as the Master, press [SELECT] [HERE] to any of the buttons of the controller. The LED color of the second button and the background of the virtual controller that identify the Master Controller is dark blue. The A/B is only linked to the Master Controller if the [SELECT] is assigned to A/B. The Master Controller is linked to the Master Controller Keys. The Master Controller has 4 buttons associated: [GO] - Initiates a forward timed fade between cues in the selected Qlist using the Cue Time. [BACK] - Initiates a backward timed fade to the previous cue using the Default Back Time. [HOLD] - Pauses the progress of a fade. Pressing [HOLD] again resumes the transition. Pressing [GO] will resume the transition as well. Pressing [BACK] will fade to the previous cue. [GOTO] - Advances to the specified cue using the GOTO Time. Master shortcuts There are some syntax shortcuts used to speed up the programming that are always referred to the Master Controller. The most common ones are: [STORE] [STORE] - stores a Cue to the first free position of the Qlist loaded on the Master. [STORE] [ENTER] - stores a Cue to the first free position of the Qlist loaded on the Master. [CUE] [#] [STORE] - stores a Cue # to the Qlist loaded on the Master. [CUE] [#] [UPDATE] - updates the Cue # of the Qlist loaded on the Master. [CUE] [#] [EDIT] or [TEXT] or [TIME] or any other command - applies the command to the Cue # of the Qlist loaded on the Master. [UPDATE] - opens the update popup, where the Master Controller can be assigned as Source Filter. [GRAB] - opens the Grab popup, where the Master Controller can be set as Filter. GOTO Commands GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system GOTO Time: [CUE] [#] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using a specified Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] - Enter time value [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system Cue Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using Goto Cue popup: Press [GOTO] - Goto Cue popup will open. Select {Qlist} if not the current Qlist on the Master Controller. Select the {Cue}. Select behavior. {Default GOTO time} - Uses system default GOTO Time. {Cue Time} - Uses Cue’s recorded time. {Custom} - Set GOTO time using the Custom Time wheel or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and set the time value from the keypad. {Release Master PB on Top} - Releases the Master Controller. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] to close the popup and execute the GOTO. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one on the Master Controller. GOTO a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [GO] (Controller must have a GO button assigned). GOTO Cue Zero (Cue Zero is essentially {Release PB}): [CUE] [0] [GOTO] GO out of sequence directly to a Cue on the Master Controller (in cue time): [CUE] [#] [GO] 11.3.2 Operation Keys Operational Keys allow to manage the controllers with basic and fundamental operations. The Operation Keys are physical buttons on the panel and can be added as virtual a view on the layout. The Operational Keys are: Select, Load, Release, Free, Protect [Select] - Sets the target controller as the Master. [Load] - Preloads a controller with a specified cue #, but does not advance to that cue. [Release] - Releases the destination controller from affecting the stage (Turns it off). [Free] - Unloads the content from the controller (Makes it empty). [Protect] - Locks the system with a user defined one-time password. [Select] [Load] [Release] and [Free] do not work with the big Master Controller buttons, only with any button on the controller that is associated with it as the [SELECT] controller. GOTO and LOAD are used to crossfade to cues out of sequence. By default: GOTO immediately transitions to the specified cue in the system GOTO Time. LOAD preloads controllers. The next [GO] will transition to the preloaded cue in Cue Time. Select Operations Set a target controller as the Master: [SELECT] [HERE] to any controller button. The Mid and Flash buttons’ LEDs and the Virtual controller’s background become Blue. Load Operations Load a cue on the Master Controller: [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - To Controller assigned as [SELECT] Press [GO] - On Controller assigned as [SELECT] LOAD a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - Qlist and Cue will be preloaded. Press [GO] - Controller will execute loaded cue. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Controller is specified, that Qlist will replace the current one with the specified cue pending. Release Operations Vibe has two types of release functions, Editor Release and Controller Release. The following deals with Controller Release. Controller Release is done using the system Release Time, as set in system default settings. Release a controller: [RELEASE] [HERE] to any controller button. Pressing Release turns the Release button Red. Release more controllers: [RELEASE] [RELEASE] [HERE] [HERE] [HERE]… to any controller button. Pressing Release two times turns the Release button flashing Red. Release All controllers. [VIBE] + [RELEASE] Free Operations Free unloads a controller and makes it empty, but it does not delete the loaded object. Free a controller: [FREE] [HERE] to any controller button. Pressing Free turns the Free button Red. Free more controllers: [FREE] [FREE] [HERE] [HERE] [HERE]… to any controller button. Pressing Free two times turns the Free button flashing Red. Free All controllers. [VIBE] + [FREE] Protect Operations Protect is used to prevent the console to be operated by unwanted people. Protect uses a user defined one-time password to Lock the system, keep the password in mind and use it carefully. To Lock the system: [PROTECT] [PASSWORD] (any sequence of numbers) [ENTER] To Unlock the system: [PROTECT] [PASSWORD] [ENTER] OR Tap on the screen, Tap [UNLOCK], insert the [PASSWORD], Tap [UNLOCK] 11.3.3 Command Keys Command Keys allow to manage the playback of the objects on the controllers, providing “On the Fly” access to button functions not directly assigned to controllers. The Command Keys are physical buttons on the panel and can be added as a virtual view on the layout. The Command Keys are: [Assert] - Takes back control of parameters that have been “robbed” by other controllers. Assert acts as a Go command, but recalling the current Cue instead of the next one. [Flash] - While pressed turns a controller On and at 100%. [Latch] - Not implemented yet.. [Solo] - Turns off the intensity parameters on all controllers excluding the target controller. [||&lt;] - Hold/Back command on a controller. If a controller is running, pauses the controller. If a controller is static, initiates a BACK command to the previous Cue using the Back Time or the Cue Time (as set in system timing settings). [&lt;-&gt;] - Reverses the sequence direction (mainly used with loops and chasers). [&lt;&lt;&lt;] - Steps backwards through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [BACK] will also step backwards through the list. [&gt;&gt;&gt;] - Steps forwards through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [GO] will also step forwards through the list. [Go] - Go command on a controller. Initiates a GO command to the next cue using the Cue Time. [Go/Release] - First press initiates a GO command, second press initiates a RELEASE command. [On] - Instantly turns ON a controller. [Off] - Instantly turns OFF a controller.  All Command Keys work with the same syntax, that is also common to the Free and Release Operation Keys. Command a controller: [COMMAND] [HERE] to any controller button. Pressing the Command turns the Command button Red. Command more controllers: [COMMAND] [COMMAND] [HERE] [HERE] [HERE]… to any controller button. Pressing the Command two times turns the Command button flashing Red. Command All controllers. [VIBE] + [COMMAND] 11.3.4 Mode Keys The Controller Mode keys are located at near the motorized sliders. The motorized sliders may be assigned to any one of 4 modes. Controller modes are are designed for “On the Fly” usage, allowing a quick modification to various rate and effect parameters. [FADERS] - Normal behavior for the Sliders, as assigned in Controller Definitions [RATE] - The Sliders control the Rate of the fades, loops, effects, and chasers on the controller. Motorized faders will move to an optimized position of 33% allowing for proportional adjustment of a controller’s rate. [SIZE] - The Sliders proportionally adjust the size of effects running on the controller. [CHANNEL] - The Sliders control single DMX Addresses. Not implemented yet. 11.4 Controller Configuration Controller buttons and sliders may be customized to allow maximum flexibility. When Objects are initially assigned to Controllers, the buttons are configured as per the System Settings Defaults for Controller Actions and Controller Settings. Each Controller may be configured individually by pressing [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any button of the controller or by tapping the box of the Playback Status view. 11.4.1 Playback Status Playback Status is a view that shows the current live information of the controller’s content and configuration. The PB Status may be added to the layout as a single box, for a single controller, or as a set of five consecutive controllers, usually positioned in the lower part of the screen. The view’s settings allow to set which target controller is shown, that may be the A/B Crossfader, a Slider, a Qkey, an AuxKey or a Global Slider. The contents shown on the PB Status are: Controller Page and Number Loaded object Number and Name Loaded Object Type (based on the background color coding) Fader Level (with Purple background) Crossfade Rate Level (with Green background) Previous, Current, Next Cue (for Qlists and Chasers) Fader and Buttons Function Icons Playback Status are also used for a direct access to the controller’s actions and settings and for the content’s properties configuration. 11.4.2 Controller Defaults Controllers’ Defaults are divided in Actions and Settings. To edit the defaults, open System Settings and tap on the Defaults Tab, then: Tap Controller Actions to open the Default Controller Actions popup Tap Controller Settings to open the Default Controller Settings popup 11.4.3 Controller Actions Assign Buttons and Slider Behavior: Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any button of the controller that has an object assigned to it - The Controller Actions popup will appear. Alternatively, tap any of the controller Playback Status on the monitor. Alternatively, press [Play-B] [#.#] [SETTINGS] on the hardkeys. Tap one of the assignable {Button} or {Slider} - A context sensitive drop down menu based on the object assigned and the specific button selected will appear. Choose a Control behavior from the menu. Assignable Button Behavior: Blackout - Disables the Button. Back - Fades to the previous Cue in Back Time. Flash - Brings the Intensity to 100%. Go - Fades to the next Cue in Cue Time. Go Release - Toggles between Go and Release commands in Cue Time and Release Time. Go Reverse - Fades to the previous Cue in Cue Time. Group Deselect - Deselects the Fixtures currently activated from the Controller. Group Release - Releases the Fixtures currently activated from the Controller. Group Select - Selects the Fixtures currently activated from the Controller. Hold - Pauses the fade. Hold Back - Pauses the fade if it is running, makes a Back command if the fade is static. None - Disables the Button. Off - Makes a Release command in Cut Time. On - Makes a Go command in Cut Time. On Off - Toggles between Go and Release in Cut Time. Release - Releases the controller in Release Time. Solo - Turns off the intensity parameters on all the other controllers. Step Back - Fades to the previous Cue in Cut Time. Step Forward - Fades to the Next Cue in Cut Time. Teach - Adjusts the Rate of Effects and Chasers based on the Tap Beat press timing. Assignable Slider Behavior: None - Disables the Fader. Intensity Master - Controls the Dimmer or Virtual Dimmer parameter of the Cue/Scene. Crossfade - Acts as a single crossfader. Crossfade In - Acts as the In crossfader of a dipless crossfader pair. Crossfade Out - Acts as the Out crossfader of a dipless crossfader pair. All Parameters - Controls all the parameters of the Cue/Scene. Non Dimmer - Controls all the parameters except the Dimmer of the Cue/Scene. Crossfade Rate / BPM - Proportionally adjusts the Rate of the Chaser. FX Rate - Proportionally adjusts the Rate of the running Effects. FX Size - Proportionally adjusts the Size of the running Effects. FX Offset - Proportionally adjusts the Offset of the running Effects. FX Base - Proportionally adjusts the Base of the running Effects. Submaster - Turns the Scene into a Submaster of the fixtures involved. (available only for Scenes and Submaster) 11.4.4 Controller Settings The left column allows to select one or more controllers to be configured. If NO controllers are selected, the popup turns to the Default Controller Settings. Flash behavior Options to set the behavior of the flash button: Release On Release Pure LTP Go On Flash Latch Slider behavior Options to set the behavior of the slider: Intensity Only Go + Fade Parameters Go + Jump Parameters Release At Bottom Properties Options to set the properties of the controller: Exclude from Snap Exclude from Override Exclude from Free All Exclude from Release All Prevent from Paging Prevent from Grab Priority: Vibe keeps an LTP priority list of which controllers own parameters and the order in which they were asserted. Every time a controller is turned on, its parameters are asserted and the controller moves to the top of the list. Parameters that are still on active controllers but are currently overridden are said to be “robbed”. When the controller that owns the parameter is released from the stage, the last active controller to own the robbed parameter is now moved back to the top of the list and reasserted the parameter to the stage. This feature is very useful for “On the Fly” programming where a main Qlist may be temporarily overridden by Qkeys or Controllers and quickly restored when they are released. The Editor is always the highest propriety and will override any values from controllers until they are released or The Editor is reset. Controllers assigned the same Priority number will be LTP among themselves. Controllers with lower Priority will be overridden by controllers with higher Priority. Controllers with higher Priority cannot be overridden by controllers with lower Priority. Assign Priority: Tap the top area of a controller display, the Settings popup will open. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. OR Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button, the Settings popup will open. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. Rotate the virtual wheel to the desired Priority Group number or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and type a Priority number from 0 to 999. Move Controllers A controller can be moved to any other, even if it’s a different type of controller. The controller will be moved with all its settings and state, including intensity value etc. [MOVE], Source selection (Occupied controllers), Target selection (Empty controller) [MOVE], Source selection (Occupied controllers), @, Target selection (Any controller) [PLAYBACK], [#], [MOVE], [PLAYBACK], [#], [PASTE] 11.4.5 Object Settings The Object Settings popups depend on the object type. The hardkeys method to open every object settings popup is: [OBJECT] [#] [SETTINGS] where “Object” stands for Qlist, Cue, Scene, Library, Group, Snap, Macro The softkeys method to open every object settings popup is: Long Tap on the target object’s Softkey (some options will appear) and move the finger on the Settings key. If an object is loaded on a controller, also a direct way to access its settings is available. The controllers method to open every object settings popup is: Tap on the object name into the Playback Status box. Qlist Settings The first column allows to select one or more Qlists to be configured. If NO Qlists are selected, the popup turns to the Default Qlist Settings. The second column contains the Qlist Settings for: Qlist Mode - Turn a Normal list of Cues into a Chaser and viceversa. Qlist Direction - Toggle between Forward and Backward. Tracking - Toggle between On and Off. Qlist Name - Labels the Qlist, same as with the syntax [QLIST] [#] [TEXT] or with the long tap on the Qlist softkey and then the Text option. The third column contains the Qlist Preferences: Back to Top on release - Rollbacks to the first Cue when the controller is released. Sequence - Enables/Disables the sequence of Cues. Mark Cue at the top of the list - Adds a prepositioning Cue before the first Cue. Loop back to first - A Go command on the last Cue will fade to the first Cue. Trigger - Enables/Disables the Triggers of objects such as Macros linked to the Cues. Look Ahead - Enables/Disables the Look Ahead option of the Qlist, with priority over the System Settings. The fourth column contains the option for the Loop Go Behavior: Go Next Exit Loop At End Fade To End Of Loop Finish Loop And Pause Restart Loop Finish Cue And Pause Finish Cue And Exit Each of these options has a short explanation in the box below the column. The Release Time Wheel may be used to set a specific Release Time for the Qlist, with priority over the System Settings.  If changes are made to individual controller Qlist Settings, those changes stay with the controller and are not copied or updated to other controllers with the same Qlist.  If it is desirable to update what will be copied to future assignments of the Qlist, toggle {Save to Qlist} On. Changes made to the current Qlist Settings will then be passed along the further Qlist assignments on other Controllers, in place of the Default Qlist Settings.  Qlist properties may be restored to their user defaults by tapping the {Restore Default} key. Chase Settings Chase Settings Tab is enabled only when the selected Qlist is in Chaser Mode. The first column allows to select one or more Chasers to be configured. If NO Chasers are selected, the popup turns to the Default Chaser Settings (not implemented yet). The second column contains the Chaser Settings for: Chaser Mode - Toggle the Chaser Time between Rate and BPM. Chase Pattern - Defines the Chase behavior affecting the order of the Cues. The third column contains the Chaser Time Preferences: BPM - Sets the BPM of the fades, only enabled when the Chaser Mode is BPM. Loop Count - Sets the number of loops that the Chaser will execute. If the Loop Count is 0, the quantity of Loops will be infinite. The fourth column contains the Chaser Properties: Int Limit - Limits the Intensity of the Dimmer parameters. X-fade - Sets the crossfade between the Cues from 100% (full fade) to 0% (step fade)  The same options to {Save to Qlist} and {Restore Default} of the Qlist Settings tab, are also available in the Chase Settings tab. Cue Settings Cue Settings popup opens by tapping on the Cue name into the Playback Status box. The first column allows to select the Qlist containing the Cue to be configured. The second column allows to select one or more Cues to be configured. If NO Cues are selected, the popup turns to the Default Cue Settings. The buttons under the column are used to: Re-number the selected Cues. Link the selected Cue to another. Loop the selected Cue to another, defining the number of loops to be executed. The third column contains the Cue Time Settings. The behavior lists all the timing possibilities and the Time wheel allows to adjust the selected ones. The Default buttons bring the time back to the default setting. The fourth column contains the Cue Properties. Tracking Options define the tracking behavior of the selected Cue, that can be: Cue Only Skip Cue Block Cue Default (Track) Specific buttons are used to: Force Black - Enable/Disable a Force Black Cue before the selected Cue. Color Fade and Position Fade - Toggle between Physical and Virtual to define is the fade to the selected Cue will involve the physical or the virtual parameters, respectively regarding the Color and the Position. The White fields under the columns may be used to write the Cue’s name and the Cue’s notes.  If the Cue selection is changed after editing the Cue settings, remember to press the APPLY button to store the changes, otherwise a popup will ask if you prefer to discard them.  Differently from the Qlist and Chase Settings, that can be stored only on the controller, the Cue Settings are directly stored to the Cue and kept in case of further assignments. Scene Settings The first column allows to select one or more Scenes to be configured. The second column contains the Scene Time Settings. Time In may be adjusted with the wheel. The White field under the wheel may be used to write the Scene’s name.  Differently from the Qlist and Chase Settings, that can be stored only on the controller, the Scene Settings are directly stored to the Scene, like the Cue Settings, and kept in case of further assignments. 11.4.6 Compound Controllers Controllers may be extended in width and height to make larger compound controllers. Compound controllers are used to expand the playback possibilities by getting more faders and buttons operating on the same object, so there can be more actions assigned. There is no limit as to how wide a controller may be, but for practical purposes, a limit of 6 controllers per content is suggested. For example a single Qlist can be assigned to two Sliders and two Qkeys and set the control of the controllers in the following way: 1st Slider: Intensity, Go, Back, Flash 2nd Slider: Crossfade, Step Forward, Step Back, Blackout 1st Qkey: FX Rate, On 2nd Qkey: FX Size, Off Other useful examples of compound controllers combinations are: creating additional Crossfader pairs, adding Rate control to Chasers, setting Group Selection, Deselection and Release to Submasters, and many more… If Playback slider controllers and Qkey buttons are linked to the same object, it could be comfortable to synchronize the paging of Sliders and Qkeys. This is done by pressing [VIBE] button together with the Up/Down paging buttons of either Playbacks or Qkeys. 11.4.7 Playback Master A Playback Master is a controller that masters other controllers. The LED and background color for playback master is blue. Any key command on the master will be triggered to the controlled Playbacks (GO, BACK, etc.). Any fader behavior and movement on the master will be triggered to the controlled Playbacks (Intensity, Rate, etc.). Playback Masters are stored in snaps. Set Up a PB Master Press [PLAYBACK] Tap [MASTER] on the toolbar Press any of keys of the playbacks to be mastered Press [STORE] Press any key of the controller that becomes the Playback Master. Not to be confused with the Master Controller, that can be only one at a time, the Playback Masters can be as many as needed. 11.5 Live Controller The Live Controller View is used to check and follow the playback of the Qlist, Chase or Scene loaded on the target controller. As many Live Controller Views as needed may be added to the layout, and each of them can be focused on a specific controller. The Header of the view reports the controller that is currently shown and the name of the object loaded on that controller. The List button enables/disables the automatic scrolling of the Cues. The Arrow button shows or hides the empty columns (fields with no data). The Chain button opens the Controller Selection popup. The target controller that needs to be shown on the view can be selected from the list on the popup, divided per Controller Type, Page Number and Controller Number. The Master key, when enabled, makes the Live Controller View follow the Master Controller. The Tabs on the bottom of the Live Controller view switch between: Cue Sheet - shows all the Cue’s numbers, names, times and notes.  Cue Sheet may be used to directly access the Cue’s Timing popup by tapping on the desired time cell, either to rename the Cues by tammping on the Cue Name cell and digit the text on the keyboard. Playback - shows all the Controller’s settings, actions and state. Cue Exam - shows a table of the values contained in the current Cue, listed by Fixture. Preview - shows a table of the values contained in the next Cue, listed by Fixture. 11.6 Teach Rate Rate and Teach are the features designed to directly control the fading and looping speed of chasers and effects, and are very useful for live lighting playback. Rate operates as a multiplier to linearly adjust the stored timing. Rate can be assigned as a fader Action to any controller, splitted between Crossfade Rate (used with Chasers) and FX Rate (used with Effects). Moreover the Rate button on the Controller Mode Keys sets all the sliders to control the rate. Teach operates as a “tap beat” button to adjust the rate by giving timed inputs, according to the sound rhythm. Teach can be assigned as a button Action to any controller and it affects both Chasers and Effects. Additionally the Vibe panel offers two buttons dedicated to the Rate and Teach, used to open the Rate Picker on the Smart Screen and manage many playback rates at a time. This screen view is very helpful in fine tuning chases and effects to synchronize with music or to improvise performances “on the fly”. The Rate Screen operates outside of the editor and is non destructive. Changes made in the Rate Screen are not stored in cues but may be stored and recalled in Snaps. Press the [RATE] button to open the Rate Picker on the Smart Screen. Smart Screen - Rate Picker Rate Screen Press [RATE] All loaded controllers will appear in the “Selected Controllers” section of the smart screen. All loaded controllers will be shown and all controllers with Chasers or Effects running will be selected. Pressing any physical or virtual [Key] of a controller, or tapping on the controller’s box in the Rate screen, will deselect all other controllers. Additional controllers may be toggled on or off as desired, they will appear in the Selected Controllers display. {Select All} will select all loaded controllers on the rate control. {Deselect All} will deselect all selected controllers from the rate control {Show Active} will remove all controllers in the “Selected Controllers” section that are not currently under the control of the rate wheels. Encoder wheels Wheel 1 - {Controller Rate} speeds up or slows down the cross fade rate of the controller. This may be used for cue transitions, chases, or effects. Range: 0% (Stopped) ⟶ 3000% (effectively cut time) Wheel 2 - {X Fade %} adjusts the “fade vs jump” percent of a chaser. Range: 0% (full jump) ⟶ 100% (full cross fade) Wheel 3 - {Intensity Limit} proportionally limits the intensity output of a controller. Range 0% (no intensity output) ⟶ 100% {full intensity} Wheel 4 - {Library Editor Rate} adjusts the speed that Libraries are faded into the editor. Not implemented yet. Four virtual sliders on the Rate Picker allow the same control of the encoder wheels. Extra wheels Wheel 1 - {FX Rate} adjusts the rate of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Wheel 2 - {FX Size} adjusts the size of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Wheel 3 - {FX Offset} adjusts the offset (Spread) of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Wheel 3 - {FX Base} adjusts the base values (start point) of parameters that are in running effects on the selected controllers. Reset keys {Reset FX Rate} - Resets controlled FX rates back to their stored values. {Reset FX Size} - Resets controlled size of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Offset} - Resets controlled offset of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Base} - Resets controlled effects base values back to their stored values. {Reset Ctrl Rate} - Resets all controller rates back to their default of 100%. Freeze keys {Freeze All} - Pauses all running chases and effects until the {Freeze All} key is toggled again. {Freeze Chase} - Pauses all running chases until the {Freeze Chase} key is toggled again. {Freeze Effect} - Pauses all running effects until the {Freeze Effect} key is toggled again. Freeze only affects chases and effects at the playback level, they are not released from the cue. To indentify the Freezed Controllers, an indicator will appear on the controller’s Status Box in place of the Rate value: FA for Freezed All FC for Freezed Chase FE for Freezed Effect Transport Bar When actively in the Rate Screen, physical controller keys are mapped to the rate interface and may not be used to activate Qlists, cues, or scenes. As an alternative, the transport bar may be used. To use the transport bar: Tap {Enable Controller PB} to activate the Transport Bar. (The controller keys are now active with the assigned functions). Select the controllers to control with the bar by toggling any of the controller’s physical control keys Use the transport Bar buttons to: {&lt;&lt;} Step Back {|&lt;} Back {||} Hold (Pause) {&gt;} Go {&gt;&gt;} Step Forward {Release} may be tapped at any time to deactivate the selected controllers using release time. Teach Rate Teach may be used with the button on the Rate screen or with the [TEACH] button on the panel. Set the number of taps to be averaged: {TAPx2} for 2 taps - [TEACH] button’s LED becomes Red {TAPx4} for 4 taps - [TEACH] button’s LED becomes Green {TAPx8} for 8 taps - [TEACH] button’s LED becomes Blue Tap {Teach Rate} or press [TEACH] the number of times defined. {Teach Rate} will show the number of taps received. [TEACH] will blink until the total number of taps is reached. The selected controllers’ rate will change accordingly to the average time between the pressures of Teach. [SHIFT] + [TEACH] allows to switch between 2, 4 and 8 taps with no need to open the Rate Screen.

"],["timeline.html", "Chapter 14 Timeline 14.1 Timelines 14.2 Time Code 14.3 MIDI", " Chapter 14 Timeline This chapter deals with playback automation by creating Timelines and receiving external Time Code protocols and MIDI signals to trigger the controllers. The following is covered in this chapter: 14.1 Timelines 14.2 Time Code 14.3 MIDI 14.1 Timelines Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. There is no limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show. Timelines can be added to a Timeline View and played simultaneously following an internal or external Time Code. Vibe can read the following Time Code sources: Virtual Local - Internally generated Time Code. Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI Time Code received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console. USB MIDI class compliant Time Code. MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol. Input sources from remote Multi-User consoles and devices Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks. Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source. Supported frame rates are: 24 FPS 25 FPS 29.97 FPS drop-frame 30 FPS 14.1.1 View If no layout contains a Timeline view, the first step to create a Timeline is to add a Timeline View to the layout. Unlimited Timeline views may be created and each Timeline View may have its own Time Code. As long as more Timeline views are set on different clock sources, they can load different Timelines and moved independently. If Timeline views are based on the same clock source, they will be synchronized and will load the same tracks and options. The Timeline view shows all the active Timelines and allows to enable and disable them, or play in “solo” mode. Use the Timeline view’s menu to load the Timelines on the view, as well as to create, edit or delete Timelines. 14.1.2 Record After a Timeline View has been created, timeline tracks may be recorded. Timeline events may be recorded in “real time” and then edited afterwards. Create a timeline track: Open the Timeline View menu. Tap + and the “Create New Timeline” popup will open. Select a timeline number and name. Choose Start from {Blank} or {Existing} Timeline and Apply. Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source. Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock. Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console. Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device. Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button. {Record} overwrites the existing events. {+ Record} adds new events to the existing ones. If using internal TC, press Play. If using external TC start the timecode source. The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controller’s events. When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.  Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events. Trigger a Timeline Timelines can be triggered and zoomed via the Timeline view’s transport bar. Timeline commands can be also triggered via the Editor Toolbar in Program and Playback pages. Grid View Filters Switch from the Graphical to the Grid view and viceversa with the toggle button on the control bar. In the grid view it is possible to see all events from all timelines or to filter events by timeline and see only its own events. 14.1.3 Commands These commands will affect the selected timelines in the sequence. Some sequences will affect the selected timelines regardless of their current view and some will affect them on the “Active Timeline View”. Commands for the Timeline Go to idle state Press Timeline # (+#, ⟶#, etc.) The Editor Toolbar shows the available commands: Sequence may also end with: Store – will create the timelines if they are not already created Delete – will delete the timelines if they exist Text – will open text box to give a name to the selected timelines Copy – will add the timelines to the clipboard Paste – will paste the copied timelines from the clipboard If the source is external MIDI or SMPTE timecode, press [Play] on the timecode source. The events will synchronize to the source timecode. If the source is internal, tap {Play} on the timecode view’s control bar. The internal timecode will start and events will execute. The control bar may be used to stop and rewind events when the source is internal. Record may be enabled and disabled “on the fly” to overwrite sections of a timeline track. forwards and backward using the Set Delta pop-up in the Actions drop down. To trigger Timeline commands via the panel and Editor Toolbar there is an “Active Timeline View” indicator: If there are more than 1 Timeline Views on the layout, only 1 of them can be the “Active” one. Tapping the white header of the view will select the current view as the “Active” and will remove the Active sign from the other views. Each Timeline View has an active clock. All Timeline Views that have the same clock will be automatically synced. Commands for the Active Timeline These commands will affect the Active Timeline View. Go to idle state Press Timeline from the panel You see on the Editor Toolbar the available commands: 14.1.4 Gestures Use the following gestures on the timeline view to manage the events: Tap on a single event – toggles the event selection Tap on a playback box – toggles the playback selection Tap on a marker – toggles the marker selection Rectangle draw using touch and drag – toggles all the events inside the rectangle Double-tap an empty area – clear the selection Double tap on the time bar – sets the current time to the selected time Long click an event and drag – moves the position of all the selected events Double finger vertical scroll on the view – will scroll the Timelines Double finger horizontal scroll on the time bar – will scroll the time bar Selection can have only one type of objects at a time. Selecting a timeline object (i.e. Playback, Event, Marker…) will clear all other objects selections. 14.1.5 Markers To aid in timeline navigation, Markers may be inserted. To insert a marker: Press the + at the desired location when the timeline is running. A marker will be inserted. Press ⟵ to move backwards through the markers. Press ⟶ to move forwards through the markers. Press ️ to delete a marker In the Timeline view, markers can be moved by assigning a direct time, and they can be assigned a delta. The Timeline Grid View shows the list of Markers on a dedicated tab, where they can be named. Markers’ names will appear also in the graphical view, on the bottom of the marker. 14.1.6 Move Selection The Move Selection submenu offers options to set move the selected events. It is possible to change selected event times via the physical wheels. There are 2 new buttons to assign the delta time for the selected events to the physical wheel and then move it. There are 2 physical wheels that are available for use: The left one is for moving the selected events. The right one is to change the time resolution for the current time movement. 14.1.7 Actions The Actions submenu offers options to manage the selected events. All the events can be moved on the timeline with drag&amp;drop commands in the graphical view, or by assigning a different time in the grid bar. The Actions menu allows to enable or disable the selected events, to delete them from the timeline, or to hide the disabled events from the view. In the Actions menu there is the option to Reset Slider Value from a playback and set it to a fixed value between zero and full. To clear the slider value from a timeline: Open a timelines Select the target playback On the menu, open the Actions Press Reset Slider Assign the slider value on the virtual slider popup 14.1.8 TimeStamp It is possible to view the timeline and events data in different time formats. The default time format is milliseconds, but it is also possible to use FPS format. The time format selection can be set on the Timestamp View sub-menu. 14.1.9 Audio Track Timelines can load Audio Tracks in common file formats such as .mp3 and .wav. To add an audio track to a timeline: open the Audio section on the menu tap ADD select the target timeline on the selection popup and tap Apply select the audio file on the load popup and tap Apply The Audio Track will be loaded on the top line of the Timeline, showing the file name and the audio spectrum. 14.2 Time Code Time Code is used to synchronize Vibe events with the internal timeline or external SMPTE Linear Time Code (LTC) or MIDI Time Code (MTC). 14.2.1 Connections Vibe has Time Code connectors for the following: Audio Combi Jack connector for SMPTE input with: Female unbalanced line level input on 1/4” phone jack Female 3 pin XLR balanced line level input. Female 5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI input. Female 5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI output. USB 2 and USB 3 ports for USB class compliant MIDI over USB devices. RJ45 ports for MIDI over Ethernet (Compulite devices) 14.2.2 LTC To trigger a timeline with an LTC or Linear Time Code source, the SMPTE input protocol needs to be enabled. Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button. The SMPTE Tab contains the toggle button to enable or disable the LTC input. Currently Vibe is only capable of receiving LTC inputs, but will be able to send SMPTE output in future releases. Recommended quality and level for SMPTE: SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended. As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, if long runs are to be used it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance. 14.2.3 MTC To trigger a timeline with an MTC or Midi Time Code source, the MTC input protocol needs to be enabled. Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button. The MIDI Tab contains the toggle button to enable or disable the MTC input. Currently Vibe is only capable of receiving MTC inputs, but will be able to send MTC output in future releases. MIDI Time Code is similar to the SMPTE Time Code and is used to synchronize audio, video, and lighting equipment, but unlike the SMPTE it does not use an audio signal. MTC is available in the following frame rates: 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work) 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video) 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video) 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video) 14.3 MIDI MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that was originally developed by the music industry to allow multiple MIDI sound devices to be triggered from just one source, usually a master keyboard or synthesizer. MIDI is a control protocol and does not transmit audio. Over the years the MIDI protocol has evolved to become a common way to synchronize sound, video and lighting equipment. MIDI is based on a 7-bit architecture and therefore has a theoretical limit of 127 possible notes for a keyboard. (Most pianos use only 88 notes and synthesizers even less) MIDI implementation: 16 independent MIDI channels - The channels systems listen to. 127 Note ONs - Pressing down on a keyboard. 127 Note OFFs - Lifting off a keyboard. Note On Velocity of 1 ⟶ 127 - How hard the key is struck. After Touch pressure of 0 ⟶ 127 - How much pressure is applied after the key reaches the bottom. 127 controllers each with a range of 0 ⟶ 127 - Encoder wheels or sliders. Patch changes from 0 ⟶ 127 - Change from one instrument to another. Pitch bend wheel that has a 14-bit resolution. A section for MIDI time code and other manufacturer’s “System Exclusive” information. 14.3.1 MIDI Settings To receive and generate Midi signals each protocol needs to be enabled. Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button. In MIDI Tab it is possible to enable and disable the Midi Notes, the Midi Time Code and the Midi Show Control devices. Configure MIDI: Connect all appropriate MIDI devices and power them on. Toggle a MIDI Connection source: Local MIDI is generated and received from the 5 pin DIN connectors on the back of the console. MIDI over USB is transmitted and received over standard USB connectors. The device must be MIDI over USB class compliant to work with Windows without a driver. If the device has a Windows driver available it is recommended to install the driver for optimal results. MIDI over Ethernet is supported by Windows class compliant MIDI over Ethernet and Compulite VC MIDI over Ethernet devices. Refresh MIDI Connection looks for new connections if devices have been added later. Press Apply to stay in I/O settings, press [ENTER] or tap the Apply icon to close the popup. 14.3.2 MIDI Notes In lighting MIDI notes and controllers from external sources are matched to the console’s controllers, buttons and wheels to synchronize the playback. A GO Button on console A is configured to send Note #46, and a GO button on console B is configured to receive note #46. Pressing GO on console A console will press the GO on console B. In EDM shows DJ’s frequently control lighting via MIDI touchpad controllers. To configure MIDI Notes open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button. In Midi Tab enable the Midi Notes In / Out and the Active Midi Channels on the columns. In Notes/Commands Tab it is possible to assign specific commands to the Midi notes. The numbers 0 ⟶ 127 on the MIDI grid represent 10 3/4 octaves of notes from C-0 ⟶ G-10. Tabs at the bottom filter the type of MIDI message to be received. Channel # may also be selected to filter just messages being received on the selected channel. The MIDI grid is used to select any of the 127 values available for the MIDI message types selected with the tabs. Assign MIDI Notes to Controllers: In Midi Tab enable Notes In or Notes Out. By default, all 16 available channels will be selected. Deselect as needed. In Notes/Commands Tab select the tab for the type of MIDI message to be received. Possible messages types are: Note (Note ON = press down on controller key, Note OFF = release of controller key).

MSC enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control. The MIDI Show Control protocol is an industry standard ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in 1991 which allows all types of entertainment control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications. Just like musical MIDI, MSC does not transmit the actual show media, it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance. * Courtesy Wikipedia Midi Show Control was developed as a simple standard method of triggering basic commands on dissimilar devices. Basic MSC commands are: Go Stop Fire (Generally used for macros) Also supported on receive are: All fixtures General lights Moving lights Receive MSC: Tap {MTC In} in the I/O Settings popup, Midi Tab. Match the {Device #} to number of the peer that will be sending the control commands. If the Peer # is above 111, select a Group # that matches and all devices set to that Group # will receive MSC packets. If the Peer # is 127 (Broadcast Mode) packets will be received on all devices regardless of their Device or Group numbers. Transmit MSC: Not implemented yet.

The following is covered in this chapter: 15.1 Topo View 15.2 Topo Menu 15.3 Create Topo 15.1 Topo View Topo is the short name for “Topographical Display”, it is a view used to make fast and intuitive the process of fixture selection and the triggering of stored objects. Practical samples of some Topo applications can be: show the light plan to other users (also as a patch-map for technicians), make graphical fixture selections (and forget about fixtures’ IDs), leave a smart interactive control screen to “not-expert” users, check the fixtures’ live status on the stage and easily program offline. When starting a new show any Topo view stored in the layout will be empty until the system is patched and fixtures are assigned to a Topo. Virtually unlimited Topos may be created and displayed in a Topo view. Fixtures and objects may be shared by different Topos. Topo view’s toolbar collects some visualization options to fastly center the stage and fit it to the screen, as well as an horizontal slider to zoom manually at the desired distance. The {Show Address} / {Show Name} button toggles between the visualization of the patched addresses and the fixtures names on the icons. The Topo view has 2 operating modes, switchable with the toggle button on the bottom right: {LIVE}: Topo toolbar and menu get a Green frame. Enables fixture selection and object triggering, locks the Topo editing. {EDIT}: Topo toolbar and menu get a Red frame. Enables all the Topo editing options, disables fixture selection and object triggering. 15.2 Topo Menu The Topo Menu is a hierarchical menu that provides the tools for creating and editing Topos. It provides the TOPO selection, with options to create, edit, duplicate and delete topos, and following sub-menus: Add Elements Selection Tools {Add Elements} - Accesses the available objects: {Sets} Opens the filter of all available sets: Fixture, Channels, Spots, Matrix, Servers, and users created sets. {Groups} Opens the filter of all available groups. {Libraries} Opens the filter of all available libraries (Intensity, Position, Color, …). {Macros} Opens the filter of all available macros. {Snaps} Opens the filter of all available snaps. {Filters} Opens the filter of all available filters. {Pixel Mapper} Adds a User definable matrix to be used for Pixel Mapping. {From Editor} Allows to Drag&amp;Drop on the Topo the elements that are selected in Vibe’s editor. {Text Label} Opens a popup to create a customizable text label. {Line} Adds a customizable line. {Background} Adds/Removes a customizable and adjustable background image. {Selection} – Accesses the selection options:  All types of selection must start outside of the fixture icons. Rectangle: Selection by creating a rectangular shape, dragging from left to right or right to left to surround the target objects. Lasso: Selection by creating a free-form path, dragging through the target objects. Circle with X: De-selection of all selected icons all. The same operation can be done with a double tap on an empty area of the Topo. Delete selected (only in Edit Mode). Snap to Grid: Fixtures and object will snap to the nearest grid node. Sync to Editor: Fixtures can be selected using the embedded keypad (only in Edit Mode). {Tools} - Accesses the smart adjustment options: {Align}: Aligns the selected elements horizontally to the left, center or right, and vertically to the top, middle or bottom. The alignment can also be set on a circular or a square shape and between two points it is possible to adjust the element location on the shape, the radius and the ending point. {Align to Point}: A base point must be specified on the Topo surface as a starting reference. The options are the same as Align except there is no point to point. {Spread} (Fan): Spreads the selected elements horizontally from the left, center or right, and vertically from the top, middle or bottom. When Spread is selected, a virtual modifier wheel will appear. {Transform} - Modifies size and rotation of the objects to scale and rotate and to rotate of 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. The last icon is to resets the transform options. {Arrange by Calibration} - When tapped, selected fixture icons get their positions from the XYZ calibration. 15.3 Create Topo To create a new Topo: Navigate to a Topo view Tap the {+} key in the Topo Menu. - The “Create New Topo” popup will appear. Select the desired Topo number, and give the Topo a unique name. Enter the size of the Stage surface. The stage dimensions may be in be in Imperial or Metric. This default is set in the System Settings popup. Select the stage point of view. The default is Top view. Tap Apply or press [ENTER] - This closes the popup, enters Topo {Edit} mode, and the grid will be displayed. 15.3.1 Add Fixtures There are two ways to add fixtures to a Topo Using keypad selection: Press zoom option {FIT STAGE TO SCREEN} on the toolbar at the bottom of the Topo View to see the whole stage area. Select the fixtures using the keypad or a group. Tap {FROM EDITOR} on the toolbar at the bottom of the Topo View. Selected fixtures will now appear in the top right section of the Topo. The fixtures will be selected (outlined in red), and can be dragged freely into place. Double tap in a clear space on the TOPO to deselect. If the {From Editor} key is selected with a long press (held for a few seconds) the fixtures may be directly dragged from the {From Editor} area. Only a maximum of 5 fixture icons will be shown but the whole selection will actually be there. Drag the fixtures to a location on the Topo view and drop. The fixture icons will now appear on the Topo surface. The reference point for dropping the fixtures is the top left corner of the dragged fixture icons. Using {ADD ELEMENTS} from the Topo menu: Create the Topo From the Topo menu tap {ADD ELEMENTS} From the drop down, tap {SETS} From the next drop down, select a fixture set - A list of the fixture in the set will drop down. From the fixture list, select the fixtures to drag onto the Topo. Press, hold and drag the fixtures onto the Topo surface. Double tap in a blank area of the Topo to deselect the fixtures. Add Sub Devices to the Topo View Topo view supports the fixture layers, so sub-devices of a fixture (for example 70, such as fixture 70.1 -&gt; 70.7), can be added as independent objects. 15.3.2 Add Softkeys There is an option to add softkeys of any type to the Topo with dragging and dropping items from the menu. Using the same methods for adding fixtures to the Topo, drag the objects into the grid. Softkey objects that can be currently added to the Topo include: Groups Libraries Macros Snaps Filters Softkey object icons can be arranged on the Topo in the same way the fixture icons are. 15.3.3 Add Pixel Maps The pixel mapper creates a matrix of fixtures. The aspect ratio of the pixel map is controlled by the number of columns and rows that are created. Matrix fixtures may be selected by blocks using the rectangle or the lasso selection tools. Create a new pixel mapper: From the Topo Actions menu, tap {Add Elements} From the {Add Elements} drop down, tap {Pixel Mapper} - The Create New Pixel Mapper popup will appear. Fill in the number of columns and rows and set the start position and direction. Press [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup and create the blank pixel map.  Currently, the pixel map will appear in the top right corner and in some cases, a zoom out will be needed to find the pixel map and drag it back to the desired location.. Using the same methods for adding fixtures to the Topo, drag the fixtures into the pixel map matrix. Release the fixtures and they will populate the pixel map.  The number of fixtures must not exceed the number of pixel mapper cells.. The populated matrix in {Edit} Mode will display the fixture numbers in each cell. In {Live} Mode, the fixture’s color mix will be shown. CMY, RGB, and HSV color spaces are supported.  Multiple pixel mappers may be added to the same Topo along with other objects.  The current Pixel Mapper is for the selection of fixtures and displaying of live output but future versions will add the ability to map content to individual pixel maps. 15.3.4 Add Text Labels Text labels of any color can be added don the Topo, for example to put notes, descriptions, or important information. Create a new text label: From the Topo Actions menu, tap {Add Elements} From the drop down, tap {Text Label} - The Create Label pop-up will appear. Close the pop-up and the test label will appear on the Topo surface. Drag the label to the desired location. Transpose tools may be used to size and rotate the label. 15.3.5 Add Background Backgrounds images, such as studio layouts, renderings and rig elements, may be added to the Topo. Add a new background: Prepare a USB stick with a JPEG, BMP, or PNG file content. Insert the USB stick into one of the Vibe’s USB ports. Tap {Add Elements} on the Topo menu. Tap {Add Background} - A browser popup will appear. Select the USB stick and click on the desired content - Once imported, the content may be found in the default local directory on the hard-drive under D: Tap {Load}, [ENTER] or tap Apply to close the popup and place the content as a background to the Topo. Remove a background: Tap {Add Elements} on the Topo menu. Tap {Remove Background}. Edit a background: Topo background images can be edited in size and position, through the tools under the Add/Remove Background buttons.

The following is covered in this chapter: 17.1 Console Network 17.2 Compulite ePorts 17.3 ArtNet and sACN 17.4 RDM 17.5 OSC 17.6 CITP 17.1 Console Network Vibe has two user accessible Ethernet networks: Data Network - Accessible via the two EtherCON connectors on the rear panel. ◾ Used for Art-Net, sACN, Compulite VC protocol nodes and Master/Slave backup. General Networks - Accessible via the two RJ45 connectors on the rear panel. ◾ Used for Network storage of show files and remote diagnostics. Each network device must have its own unique static IP address in the form of four triplets xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, to identify it on the network. In Vibe, this can be set in the System Settings popup. It is not necessary to have three digits in each segment of the IP but there must be at least one digit in each segment. Vibe ships with a default Subnet Mask of 255.0.0.0 which means that it is only important that the first triplets of the IP (the start address) must match on all devices in the network. Devices on the same network must not have identical IP addresses. Common Start IP addresses: 2.x.x.x - Default for Art-Net networks. 10.x.x.x - Default for most ETC networks and alternate for Art-Net network. 192.x.x.x -Default for most MA consoles. Subnet Mask - Identifies the network itself and in conjunction with the IP address can be used to properly route network devices. 255.0.0.0. - Compulite Default. Only the first triplet must match. 255.255.0.0 - Common in configurations with different systems on the same network. The first and second triplets must match. 255.255.255.0 - Common in configurations with many different systems on the same network. The first, second and third triplets must match. Not suggested for networks having more Compulite consoles connected. Compulite uses the third triplet as a console identifier in some of the products. The Vibe can be used in networks using a DHCP server but cannot act as a DHCP server. Switches: Vibe has two internal switches so single direct device to device connections are possible without a cross cable. When more than one device must be connected to the Vibe a good quality gigabit switch should be used. Many systems have gone down due to bad Ethernet cabling and cheap switches. It is recommended that EtherCON connectors are used where possible in conjunction with professional grade switches designed for lighting and audio applications.. 17.1.1 Network Settings Open the {NETWORK SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the Network Settings button - The Network popup will open. Local: Option to set the local information of the console such as IP and name. Unlock the boxes to edit the fields. Console State: There are 2 possible individual states: Stand Alone (Default) – Console is not in a session but networking for outputs, remotes and external connections are active. Local (Offline) – Same as Stand Alone but disables the DMX over Ethernet. User ID: Not implemented yet.. Start Session: The console becomes a Master, meaning it’s hosting a session where Backup consoles can be connected. Online IP Devices: Displays all Valid IP based devices active on the network. Delete Selected: Remove the selected devices from the list. Clear IP Devices: Clear the whole IP device list. Connect As … / Disconnect: Related to starting or ending a session with a master console. 17.2 Compulite ePorts Compulite manufactures the ePort brand of DMX over Ethernet nodes. Supported Protocols: ePort 41 - Prior to Sept 2016 (check serial number with Compulite to confirm) ◾ Compulite VC protocol ◾ Art-Net v2 ePort-41 - Current ◾ sACN pre-release and release versions ◾ Art-Net 3 ◾ Compulite VC protocol ePort-8 and ePort-2 ◾ sACN pre-release and release versions ◾ Art-Net 3 ◾ Compulite VC protocol For more product information, see ePort Documents. Any ePort can be connected and configured directly from Vibe’s External Devices View or by using the CNET Manager software, available on Compulite website www.compulite.com Vibe External Devices View C-Net Manager software Configure ePorts: Make sure that the Vibe IP and the ePort IP are in the same range. Assign universes to each physical port by typing the universe number in the box below the icon of the physical connector. Select the DMX-ON-Ethernet protocol in the protocol list. If Art-Net is selected make sure the Art-Net Subnet is also set. In most cases this will be set to 0 which allows the first 16 universes. It must be incremented by one with each new range of 16 universes. Tap {Update} to apply all the changes. 17.3 ArtNet and sACN Vibe supports transmission of 256 universes on DMX over Ethernet using the industry standards of Art-Net versions 1 ⟶ 3, ad sACN (ANSI E1.31-2016 standard). Enable Art-Net or sACN output: Open the {DMX SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the DMX Settings button - The DMX Properties popup will open. Under the Protocol heading, tap {Art-Net} or {sACN} - The selection will turn red. Under Broadcast Options (VC, Art-Net, sACN) tap {Out} - The status indicator light will turn green. The console will now be outputting the selected protocol on the EtherCON Data ports. Vibe is capable of transmitting more than one protocol at a time on the same Ethernet port. To save bandwidth it is also possible to enable only the universes for each protocol that are required. Vibe has separate universe patches for VCs, Art-Net, and sACN. By default, universes are patched 1 to 1 for each protocol. It is possible to reroute universe output destinations. The Vibe is licensed for 64, 96, 128, or 255 console source universes but these universes may be freely rerouted to any destination universe from 0 ⟶ 256 as long as the total amount of universes does not exceed the purchased license. Reroute Console Universes: Under the Source Universe header, scroll the list to the source console universe number you wish to route. Once tapped, the selection will turn red. A universe number may also be typed from the keypad. Under the Destination Universe header, tap one of the cells in the destination universe grid. The source universe number will now be routed through the destination universe number. Additional functions: Clear a destination universe - Tap {Universe #} in the destination grid. Tap {Clear}. Clear all destination universes - Select the protocol to clear. Tap {Clear All}. Reset default route for a single destination universe - Tap {Universe #} Tap {Config}. Reset all defaults for the selected protocol - Tap {Config All}. Art-Net Subnet View: Art-Net is designed in blocks of 16 universes. The blocks starts at subnet 0 and increments by 1 every 16 universes. The subnet number and fixture number in the subnet can be viewed by toggling {Subnet View}. Unicast Option for Art-Net and VC It is possible to set specific IPs to send the output to. If there is a port configured to a specific IP it will not be sent broadcast. Ports that are not defined as unicast will be still sent as broadcast. Each port can be configured to multiple IPs. Few ports can be sent to the same IP. Configure Unicast: Tap on the protocol in DMX Settings popup. Toggle to Unicast Settings to open the unicast popup. Tap Add to add a new IP line or Delete to remove an existing IP On the first line – ports 1 ⟶ 5 will be sent to IP 172.16.10.10 On the second line – port 5 will be sent also to IP 172.16.10.11 On the third line – ports 6 ⟶ 10 will be sent to IP 172.16.10.12 17.4 RDM RDM is fully supported on the 8 physical DMX output ports and Compulite VC protocol. View RDM information: Open the External Devices View. Tap the RDM Devices tab. Tap {Get Devices} on the view’s menu - The system will scan and display RDM compliant devices. If new devices are added, press {Re Scan}. 17.5 OSC OSC (Open Sound Control) is a protocol for networking with sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices for purposes such as musical performance or show control. OSC enables a text string based exchange of commands and triggers between different devices via a network connection, that is used to establish the synchronization between different systems. Connections with OSC can use TCP or UDP protocol for direct communication over the network. OSC Input Vibe supports the OSC input protocol using TCP, UDP, or both. In the I/O Settings popup, on the OSC tab, there is the list of supported OSC strings as well as OSC ports and protocols. Custom OSC strings can also be created by the user. OSC Output Vibe supports the OSC output protocol using TCP, UDP, or both. The OSC view shows the existing commands, allowing the user to create and edit custom commands and to send immediate commands and use keyboard arrows to re-send commands from the cache. OSC commands can be attached to Cues with the syntax: [QLIST], [#], [CUE], [#], [ATTACH_OSC] (toolbar). 17.6 CITP The CITP (Controller Interface Transport Protocol) is a network protocol used between lighting control consoles, visualizers and media servers. The protocol allows to transport information, browse media and thumbnails, stream media among different devices. CITP Settings popup gathers all the CITP capabilities of the Vibe together. To open the CITP Popup: Tap Vibe menu button In Settings, tap CITP Settings or Tap [CITP Settings] button. In the popup there are 4 tabs: General Media Servers Visualizers Consoles 17.6.1 General This tab shows the general information about the console and gives the option to enable/disable CITP communication from/to the console. 17.6.2 Media Servers This tab shows a list of the detected Media Servers on the network. In order to connect to a media server and start a session, select a media server from the list and press Connect. In order to link a media server to a specific fixture, select a connected media server from the list and tap Configure. A popup will appear where you can choose which fixtures you want to link. In order to get all the available data from a media server, select a connected and linked media server from the list, and tap Get Data. All available data such as thumbnails, effects etc. will be synced from the media server to the fixtures on your show. 17.6.3 Visualizers This tab shows a list of the detected Visualizers on the network that are using CITP. To connect to a visualizer and start a session, select it from the list and tap Connect. To get the patch from a connected visualizer, select it from the list and tap Get Show.  This action will clear the current show data, get the devices, fixtures, numbers, patch, XYZ information from the visualizer and automatically create them on your show. Auto Patch from Capture It is possible to sync the show from Capture. In order to do that, set the Capture CITP settings to use Standard Multicast and select the relevant IP address. In addition, make sure Vibe and Capture are on the same subnet. After finishing preparing the show on Capture, go to Vibe, open the CITP popup, enable CITP and connect to Capture from the Visualizers tab. Then Get Data from Capture and Vibe will be ready to go. 17.6.4 Consoles This tab shows a list of the detected Consoles on the network that are using CITP and their state.
