[["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Unboxing 1.2 Getting Started 1.3 Guide Conventions 1.4 Important Terms", " Chapter 1 Introduction This chapter discusses getting started with your Compulite Vibe console. The following is covered in this chapter: 1.1. Unboxing 1.2. Getting Started 1.3. Guide Conventions 1.4. Important Terms 1.1 Unboxing TBA. 1.2 Getting Started Power requirements:  Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz.  Approximately 3.2 amps at 230V.  Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country. Desk Light:  Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console.  Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Monitor intensity:  Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Power up the console:  Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks.  Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector.  Press the Power button located at the upper right corner of the monitor panel above the USB connectors.  The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch. Power down the console:  Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open.  Tap { Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} Pop-up will appear.  Tap {Yes} or {No}.  The Vibe application will shutdown and a screen will appear with the following options: {Shut Down the Console} - System will power off {Restart Vibe} - Vibe console application will restart {Open Offline Tool} - the Vibe utilities app will open. Hardware and software updates are preformed in the Offline Tools app. Choose Shut Down the Console - The console will safely power off. 1.3 Guide Conventions  [XXXX] - Physical key  {XXXX} - Soft key ยง [ ] { } - Example  Press - Action applied to a physical key  Tap - Action applied to softkey or virtual key  Toggle - Action that actives and deactivates with alternating taps or presses  Key - Any physical or virtual key that is NOT used for controller activation  Button - Any virtual or physical key that is used to activate a controller  Keypad - Embedded numeric keypad  Keyboard - Consoles pull-out ASCII keyboard or any external keyboard  SK - Object softkeys (Libraries, Groups, Snap, Macros, etc.)   - Hint or suggestion  RED - Important information or Caution  [Here] - Short form for Press an appropriate destination softkey or controller button to complete the command 1.4 Important Terms DMX 512 Output/Input Port - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter. DMX 512 Universe - Virtual DMX outputs 0  256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols.  Compulite VC protocol  w Art-Net 3 w  sACN SET = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets), 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures), 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors), 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures), 4 = Servers (Video servers), 5  1000 = User defined sets Parameter - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo. Controllers - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots. Submaster - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value. Master Controller - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys. Slider - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader. Qkey - A single button Controller. Assert - Takes back control of parameters that have been robbed by other controllers. HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence) - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications. LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence) - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output its values to the stage no matter what the value. [SELECT] - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller. Qlist - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999. Cue - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values. Scene - A look that exists independent of a Qlist. Library - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced. Options - Used to modify object properties on the fly Settings - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created. Cue Zero - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid. For the sake of this guide, Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function.
