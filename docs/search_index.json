The following is covered in this chapter: 1.1 Getting Started 1.2 Guide Conventions 1.3 Important Terms 1.4 Releases 1.1 Getting Started Power requirements: Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz. Approximately 3.2 amps at 230V. Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country. Desk Light: Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console. Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Monitor intensity: Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Power up the console: Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks. Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector. Press the Power button located at the upper right corner of the monitor panel above the USB connectors. The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch. Power down the console: Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open. Tap {Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} Pop-up will appear. Tap {Yes} or {No}. The Vibe application will shutdown and a screen will appear with the following options: {Shut Down the Console} - System will power off. {Restart Vibe} - Vibe console application will restart. {Open Offline Tool} - the Vibe utilities app will open. Hardware and software updates are preformed in the Offline Tools app. Choose Shut Down the Console - The console will safely power off. 1.2 Guide Conventions [XXXX] - Physical key {XXXX} - Soft key [ ] { } - Example Press - Action applied to a physical key Tap - Action applied to softkey or virtual key Toggle - Action that actives and deactivates with alternating taps or presses Key - Any physical or virtual key that is NOT used for controller activation Button - Any virtual or physical key that is used to activate a controller Keypad - Embedded numeric keypad Keyboard - Console’s pull-out ASCII keyboard or any external keyboard SK - Object softkeys (Libraries, Groups, Snap, Macros, etc.)  - Hint or suggestion RED - Important information or Caution [Here] - Short form for Press an appropriate destination softkey or controller button to complete the command 1.3 Important Terms DMX 512 Output/Input Port - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter. DMX 512 Universe - Virtual DMX outputs 0 ⟶ 256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols. ◾ Compulite VC protocol ◾ w Art-Net 3 w ◾ sACN SET = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets) 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures) 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors) 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures) 4 = Servers (Video servers) 5 ⟶ 1000 = User defined sets Parameter - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo. Controllers - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots. Submaster - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value. Master Controller - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys. Slider - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader. Qkey - A single button Controller. Assert - Takes back control of parameters that have been “robbed” by other controllers. HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence) - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications. LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence) - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output it’s values to the stage no matter what the value. [SELECT] - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller. Qlist - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999. Cue - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values. Scene - A look that exists independent of a Qlist. Library - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced. Options - Used to modify object properties “on the fly”. Settings - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created. Cue Zero - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid.  For the sake of this guide, Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets  Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function. 1.4 Releases 1.4.1 R_3.0 Release Date: 06/09/2020 DB version: R_3.0 Desktop version: R_3.0 LPU version: R_3.0 HAL version: R_3.0 Device Pack version: DP_3.0 1.4.1.1 Version Highlights Version R_3.0 brings new and updated features as listed below: Settings Controller Default Actions- It is now possible to set a default controller action for each object type on each controller type.

Crash in timeline when dragging hidden disabled events. Crash on HAL when pressing multiple times on Swap Display Small Screen wheels could disappear in some sequences. Big performance improvements. Store/Update/Delete cue bugs with all options (tracking, cue only and more) Releasing cue cells had wrong effect on qlists. Cues manipulation with physical vs. virtual params caused wrong behavior in certain sequences Library manipulation on cues had issues with the tracking data A/B fader issues CITP errors with unpatched fixtures or fixtures with the same number or fixtures with the same patch. GO within GO did not proceed 2 cues If there was a situation of BACK within BACK until the empty cue then the playback made double fade to empty. Update device popup after load show did take all changes into consideration and some updated devices were not shown Parameter adjustment that happened not on the first parameter page made a jump back to the first page. Echoline did not show the current set when using [.]. Echoline is not displaying the correct fixture number after having a selection and Next or Prev. Storing a library from the popup did not consider the number on the popup. [TEXT, SCENE SK] – did not display the scene name on the popup. Cue text popup did not display the cue name correctly. Timeline did not show object names correctly on text popup. Scrollable views scrollbar thumb was too small and was broken. There was no scrollbar option in Universe View. When there is more than 1 device and ‘Headers per device’ option is enabled, disable the ‘Active on stage’ should change the live view scroll bar to its original size. Topo View background no longer resets after changing name/resolution Topo View spread center of selection calculation fixed Set a cell time to a color layer will set the cell time to next color layer Views that need to keep their ratio did not do it correctly Maximize did not consider View’s ratio Sometimes Wheel Picker was not refreshing correctly from DMX values Window buttons (page toggles) was not working right on external windows Unlocked icon was not synced with the current edit state Save layout when in all pages caused pages to disappear If a device has more than one dimmer param, tapping on the dimmer values in Intensity bank should apply the values to all dimmer params. When there is more than one context view, you can get to a state that they are showing different views When getting to a Lib view in context, the only way that context will be released is by selecting fixtures After assigning a Lib on a group using context view, context view jumps back When selecting a group from context view, it should select the fixtures immediately Cannot delete timeline marker When tapping on smart screen functions, after creating an effect with randomized fixtures, effect is changed, and fixtures are no longer randomized When changing between wheels in smart screen, the position of the fader that is in charge to the wheel or frame spin speed doesn’t change to its right position Adjusting the grand master virtual fader is out of proportion. When storing a cue in Compulite mode, it should not advance to it. When choosing fixtures using ⟶⟶ it should display the selection in echoline When choosing all fixtures using 1 ⟶⟶ it should display all the selected fixtures in echoline ⟶⟶ did not work on parameters other than dimmer Topo view is not saved like the last use (zoom and position) Topo (0,0) point is different from the (0,0) point in the Fixture calibration. When creating a TOPO with big dimensions its loading a lot of time and crashes. Topo crosslines and frame lines disappearing when playing with the zoom Can’t type values in small effect engine When clearEditorAfterStore was off, sometimes Qlists were not set in PB. When Auto Param Grouping is off, changing virtual parameter while others are empty will not calculate the output correctly Tabbing a view to the Live controller view or to Live master controller view, is creating more tabs than should with wrong names. When views are tabbed and on their minimum size possible, the tabs are hiding the bottom of the views Column resize did not work correctly on some views Issues fixed with ‘dot cues’ in some sequences GM led was not refreshed on new/load show and opening the console GM Value was not matched after new/load show or on startup Resolution button LED is off when Vibe is coming up Snap activation bugs with timings and fader levels Png images Red and Blue were switched Fixture # Address # could not put a number more than 2 digits on the address Cue time popup should not change times if they were not changed by user. (It affected range selection of cues and ruined their timing data) Cue dot (last) made cue selection to be invalid in some popups Applying libraries on selection while in selection tools did not work Manual fade to cue that also had mark time and autofollow time caused the autofollow to trigger although it shouldn’t load show on a non-empty show kept garbage in the data and made the live playback displays to show this garbage If a library had on the same fixture type mix of physical and virtual parameters, then it can cause a problem when you try to select fixtures and apply the library on them. Dirty cells in cues with virtual functions from old shows could cause strange behavior After creating new fixtures, the indication for the libraries of type Parameter Specific and Pattern were not updated Some LEDs blinked when shift+reset was pressed Timeline wheels could stuck the wheels from being shown Cant release fixtures from Group using [Edit] Values are released when giving grouped parameter a direct value Blind editor values were not shown in live if active on stage or active in editor were on Removing parameters from library would not release the parameters from cues using the library Apply library with device + fixture would work like fixture only when VFunc doesn’t exist Re-Selecting fixture and applying library did not keep the order Free All could not work if one of the playbacks had “exclude from paging” Playback leds were blinking even if fade ended on some occasions Dimmer wheel changing value only for first parameter on fixtures with many dimmers. Dragging fixtures that their patch size is 1 to the universe view did not work Dimmer wheel did not affect devices with Virtual Dimmer parameter or without dimmer at all Delete Cue could delete cues from other qlists Sliders mode did not bring back the position of the slider if it was submaster After using other editors (like blind) moving sliders and storing objects did not work Topo View some objects would stay floating after drop into Topo Topo menu objects would seem as if they still selected after closing the menu In some cases output and CITP was not working Master Slave: Disconnect button on settings popup logic changed Disconnection cleanup fixes Added small progress to disconnect process Master-Slave sync did not sync images folder Disconnect after unexpected crash Master-Slave false disconnect detection fixed Reconnect or false detection of disconnection could cause Slave to get stuck After connecting to master, all async calls did not work Sync LPU refresh depends on console state Fixed images sync that image did not appear Images sync did not work if slave did not have images folder before the sync Fixed an issue when messages could get corrupted when receiving them in IPC Fixed Crashes when switching to master but not connecting to a partner and then settings protect/topo image Fixed protect images resetting to default on System Settings Popup open Added Master standby state to differentiate between master with partner and master without partner Fixed LPU’s not connecting after network cut LPU crash Fixed reconnect issues Sometimes when recovering from crash or reconnect, the partner IP was not set right Stuck or crashed on sync if show file size was big Fixture Builder When there are collisions in steps values it does not popup a message Unsupported notes are now disabled Add a step after renaming a step will not rename the step name. Changing the text in the text boxes is sometimes not saved When you create more than 1 mode while Vibe is running, it writes next to one mode a huge number of fixtures When adding color or position params it should automatically create the virtual params When Fixture builder is opened via Vibe, touching the smart screen will stuck the system. Edit a mode that is not the first on the list using the fixture builder from the Vibe cause a crash to the fixture builder Storing changes sometimes crashed the fixture builder. Edit device tab now reopens without losing unsaved data When mapping the shutter control, it is not possible to map a step as Open Changing home/empty/highlight/lowlight values in fixture builder did not fix it in the existing fixtures Fix crash on store from EditDeviceTab Vector Show conversion If vector show was in Fixture mode, then the fixture numbers on Vibe are incorrect When auto converting Vector device to vibe the empty value of the dimmer is not right If Vector device had empty parameter vibe did not consider it in the convert match process If vector external patch was together with channel patch vibe did not patch converted show Vector device match was wrong after first conversion Vector convert did not take the look ahead mask correctly Converting Vector libraries was wrong if the library had a value from another library (nested on Vector) Did not take the invert property for parameters if the device was taken from the exiting Vibe devices Blade parameters did not convert correctly from Vector shows Also showed devices that had no fixtures in the show Added more devices to the auto convert inventory Highlight and Lowlight cues were not converted correctly Could make a mix of parameter type indexes if certain types were in the device 1.4.3 R_5.0 Release Date: 16/10/2023 DB version: R_5.0 Desktop version: R_5.0 LPU version: R_5.0 HAL version: R_5.0 Device Pack version: DP_5.0 1.4.3.1 Version Highlights Version R_5.0 brings new and updated features as listed below: General Softkey’s Header Icon The icon in the view’s header can be clicked to jump at the top of the scrollable softkey views.

Sub-Devices On Topo view Topo view supports fixture layers, so sub-devices like fixture 1.1 can be added. Playback Qlist Tracksheet Column Limit Tracksheet view allows setting the visible column limit. Timeline Markers In the Timeline view, markers can be moved by assigning a direct time, and they can be assigned a delta. QKey’s And AuxKey’s Virtual Sliders Added option to have virtual sliders for Qkeys and AuxKeys.

Fixed potential crash when a Single button on a layout was used afterwards on a new layout. Fixed Vibe stuck because of SQL resources. Fixed Topo view crash on startup if side menu is closed. Fixed potential crash with edit time box. Fixed potential crash when loading DMX Output view. Fixed potential crash when clicking grid overlay. Fixed potential crash when clicking empty playback while update cue popup is open. Fixed potential crash when QList #1000 is moved. Fixed potential crash when loading an old layout with context view. Fixed potential crash with older layouts. Fixed potential crash when running multiple undo actions at once. Fixed potential crash caused by [CUE, .]. Fixed potential crash when dragging columns on Live Controller view. Fixed potential crash when pressing F1 with smart screen focused. Import device into show (from fixture builder) did not fill the wheels info and it caused later to a crash in live view. Big Layout could cause system to get stuck. Fixed potential crash with groups update. Fixed potential crash when LPU/HAL/Desktop are loading. Fixed Fixture Builder crash when storing in media picker and then pressing back. Fixed HAL crash with multiple CITP devices connected. Fixed LPU crash on closing or loading a big show. Fixed crash when using a fixture with broken animation wheel commands. Fixed potential crash on shut down. Fixed gesturing on unused portions of the screen that may lead to crashes. Fixed Copy/Paste Library softkeys Paste crash. Device Browser dragging device onto other device could target the wrong device or crash. All Pages could crash after duplicate, lock, unlock. Vibe Bug Fixes Performance issues on Store/Update/Delete of cues. Cue Time popup did not set cue time for cues with sub number. Release cell time was writing ‘Cut’ instead of nothing. Scene time from Playback Settings was not working. Fixture Clone could get stuck if Fixtures had groups involved. Softkey icons for wheels were not accurate if value was stored on the edge of a step. Exam view LookAhead showed 0 instead of Yes-No. Fixture exam did not show libraries that can be assigned to the fixture. Store Qlist softkey did not act like Qlist # Store. Shutter picker did not refresh duration fader and buttons. Created fixtures view did not respond correctly to the selection by drag event. Copy editor cells did not copy cell time. Update cell time did not consider delay or time in of the cue if not given by the cell time. Unloop while in a loop did not stop the loop. Performance improvements on Track Sheet view. Storing library with timing created cell times even when there was no cell time in the editor. Library cells could disappear if they were on editor with white color and storing cue with [CUE, #, STORE]. Update cue could cause wrong library values. Release parameter from library did not clear the cell from cues. When going to a blocked virtual value without letting the fade to end, values were jumping. When giving cell time for some fixtures at the same time, if some of them were tracked on the next cue, going [Back] to the original cue did not fade the values correctly. Fade issues with ‘Tracking Off’ Qlist and cell time. When going to a tracked effect while it was fading to the hard effect value, it jumped to the end values of the effect. When parameters have a cell time, values fade in the cell time when pressing [Back],[Back]. If tracked parameters had a cell time, [Go] while release made the values wrong. If values are tracked, pressing Go does not affect the fade time. When a chaser had a cue with cell time, values were jumping. Copy fixture without editor values did not copy the fixture data. In DMX Settings popup Local Output the DMX input and output ports couldn’t be changed. Several views’ Scroll Bar didn’t work or didn’t preserve visible status at load layout. Topo view did not refresh with fixture renumbering. Scene # exam showed wrong scene #. Lists on the exam front page had no data after creating a new exam. Improved performance to Exam view. SHIFT+GO and BACK did not work with correct times when going into cue with tracked values. LPU sometimes calculated wrong values when fade was not at 100%. Topo softkeys cleared fixture selection before activating, making some sequences unreachable. Short Wait times could get skipped. There was still output after using Address after [Reset]. In blind mode, parameter steps names were not changing. Could reach to an empty Group state by releasing all fixtures. When applying a pre-built effect, not all params that are used in the effect were visible. If a fixture had a virtual color on one playback and physical color on another, update was selecting both and not only the source playback. If after giving a value using wheel, a selection was made using Topo, and then a selection was made using sequence, fixtures were kept selected. Directory for Save Show As and Save Layout As. Small screen pickers did not reset fan if there was one When fader is crossfade, changing between virtual and physical was not working correctly. Pressing Red X in Cue Settings did not discard all the changes. Redesigned undo infrastructure to allow more flexibility in future use. Efficiency on load snap and load snap database error fixed. Stored Snaps ignored default Snap Time changes. Text in Update popup, Cue column fields, are more readable. Home button was param grouping. Smart screen’s step selection selected the wrong wheel on the wheel picker. Snaps with Crossfader controllers were not restoring crossfader’s position. Setting a waiting cue and pressing release, now releases into waiting cue. Setting cue in waiting does not get rid of the previous playback loops. When applying a waiting snap, the object type in controller assignment was not always updated correctly. Qlist name disappeared when pressing go after setting a waiting snap. In Cue Settings the Unlink option did not work. In Cue Settings the Cue colors are according to the Live controller view. With Cue Overwrite the values were not tracked but released. Virtual parameters did not work correctly with All Params and XFade behavior. Xfade did not take LTP when triggering a cue. Xfade with single cue did not go back to 0 with manual fade. If devices with media commands were not in the media server set, their media banks were disabled on selection. Fixture Selection performance improved, especially with layers. Effects could not spread between layers. Fan did not apply Pattern correctly. Live view forgot about “Dock” option. Applying FX library on editor did not always start from the same fixture. Fixed Syntax error with Group +/- Fixture. Topo position and zoom adjustments were not saved on topo. Shift + Reset when in FX or Rate mode in small screen while there are selected fixtures, could cause async problems with pickers and wheels. Layout performance issues. In Device replacement: Libraries, Scenes, Submasters and Groups were losing connection with fixtures. Green Hippo FX selection by wheel was not following on the picker. Storing a library while rem dim is on could cause wrong values in the library. Live view in tab could not be refreshed correctly. Beam Picker did not show commands if there were no frost commands. Small screen FX when rotating hard wheels to the right was slower than to the left. Update items popup did not refresh items list if it was scrolled before. Improved performance on playbacks update. Smart screen wheels could disappear after using media bank pickers. Smart Screen Effects Relative Wheel Mode with multiple parameters updated wrong. Playback Master’s Crossfade Rate did not work on other playbacks. Playbacks runtime calculation performance improvement. Effect view: after ‘Flip’ the function was out of image’s bounds. Live view memory performance improvement. Paste Cue with Cue Only could cause a database error. Release from Library was not in the undo list and could cause wrong cell values if undo was used. Store Macro popup didn’t overwrite the name. X and V buttons removed from popups where they were not needed. Changing layout settings could change Theme even if not changed. Dragging views showed red color while resize. Qkey+Auxkey views could be created with wrong numbers. Controller Go-Off function did not work as intended. Topo view in Edit mode was not updated after Load Show. Pattern Popup did not apply to active editor cells. Effect Times applies to odd number of mirrored fixtures. Exam did not work on Patch Pages. Load snap into existing “excluded from snap” PBs with grouped controllers, led to controllers not assigned properly. Load snap with “prevent from paging” PBs or load snap INTO existing “prevent from paging” PBs, led to controllers not assigned properly. Store a snap with grouped sliders changed the number of grouped sliders and loading the snap led to controllers not assigned properly. If paging up and down with grouped controllers and “prevent from paging”, x fader was not correct on grouped controllers. Setting PB master playback on existing grouped controls led to error in DB. TEXT -&gt; SELECT on grouped controls didn’t work. If adding more grouped controllers to a PB when one of the controllers is selected, the controllers are not assigned properly. Live Controller Cue Exam did not refresh. Headers per device items could be empty or show the wrong number in the counter. Touch calibration from the settings popup on consoles did not store the changes. Fixed Fixture Renumber and Set change functions. Close and re-open the menu in LiveView caused the side menu to be lost. Live PB Exam did not show Scene data correctly. Add Set popup showed existing set numbers. Fixed bug when moving PB to Qkey and vice versa. Select a Parameter could change the context when it shouldn’t. Create Qlist from Scene popup did not work if the controller was not a slider. Assignment of events on the Timeline did not record and work correctly if the controller type was not a slider. Fixed procedures in Group/Qlist/Scene/Snap Store. Live view was overloaded with many fixtures of the same type and headers per device option. Old shows could have issues with virtual parameter relations. Topo matrix selection order was wrong when using square selection. Blind did not disable Auto Assign Cues To PB. Pan &amp; Tilt values could jump after update. Fanned values were not taken into consideration when crossfading out/in. Copy-Paste edited the copied objects’ name. Topo View Fit options did not consider scaled/rotated objects. Beam picker fader was not refreshing correctly from live if the DMX range is flipped. Delete Library if Library is on a Controller generated DB error. Overwrite Library if Library is on Controller generated DB error. Fixed Live View’s performance issues when using “Active On Stage” or “Active In Editor”. Clone To Function did not work with Groups. Long Click gestures did not work on some machines. Sometimes LPU could slow down until DMX Rate is changed manually. In Load Vector Show added an alert when not all devices have been matched or built. In Load Vector Show the popup will not close if choosing to cancel “save current show”. In Load Vector Show, Rate and Tap Beat on Playbacks were not kept In Load Vector Show did not match the latest vector shows. Some Vector shows could not load correctly if they had a parameter assigned to more than 1 bank, Performance improvement on first stage of loading a Vector show (since selecting the show until the device matching popup appears). In Load Vector Show the Control parameters did not load correctly. In Load Vector Show popup, when opening Manual Search of a device with a match, the selected device will be the matched device. Performance improvement for Load Vector Show. Load Vector Show could have wrong values when importing. Load Vector Show Manual Search matches the Vibe Devices offset. Load Vector Show Manual Search showed Unknown devices. Load Vector Show did not update some GUI fields. Load Vector Show AutoMatch improvements and manual filter. New Show popup did not show immediately and opened on 75%. Loading Popup text could get out of bounds. In Load Vector Show Tracking data was not coloring the cells right. In Load Vector Show the Conversion did not consider playback type when converting snaps. Changing IP on Vibe makes sure that the subnet is 255.0.0.0. Fixture Builder Bug Fixes Fixed a bug when deleting a parameter that could cause wrong link in commands and even crash. Fixed Add button in wheel command. Fixed grayed out functions in beam command. Fixed crash on exit. Fixed errors in wheel’s step saving. Fixed false validation errors on Store. Fixed parameters’ default wrong values. Fixed manufacturer’s saving when a device is exported. Fixed error when editing a device. Fixed error when cloning subdevice mode, where the clone says there are the same number of fixtures created as the original mode instead of 0. Fixed potential crash when creating a new subdevice on an edited device. Image file popups copy files. Fixed keystone points data. Fixed device gobos that caused database error. Fixed popup asking to save changes when no changes are made. Deleting a device that is in use in the show could cause issues. Cloning a device cloned also the number of created fixtures. Deleting a subdevice without deleting the device could cause problems to other fixtures of the device. Deleting a subdevice could cause wrong data in the show. Fixed potential crash when storing a device. The loading popup could be delayed when storing. Exit with pressing Store did not store. Offline Tool Bug Fixes The software update could fail if something was running in background. In the Offline Tool the patch version popup was wrong. Restoring the console DB on VibePC made Vibe crash on boot. Reset the layout on VibePC loaded the Console Default Layout instead of the PC Default Layout. Firmware Update didn’t work if Vibe wasn’t installed. Added loading popup for device pack update. The software update loaded the wrong default layout.

The following is covered in this chapter: 4.1. Introduction 4.2. {VIBE} Menu 4.3. Pages 4.4 WorkSpaces 4.5. Layouts 4.6. Smart Screen 4.7. Toolbars 4.8. Live Display 4.9. Live Parameter Display 4.1 Introduction Vibe uses a Multi-touch based interface with simple familiar gestures for navigation. Supported gestures: ◾ Two fingers for swipe and scrolling. ◾ One finger select. ◾ Multi-selection via ️️⤴ ⤵ shaped gestures. ◾ Multi-selection via window. Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added using DisplayPort 1.2 or higher MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large 21” embedded screen is general-purpose like the external monitors. The smaller 11.6” Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive parameter information such as color pickers and gobo pickers. Each monitor, (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain one Window Frame. Window frames can contain one of three Workspace Templates. Each Template has a dedicated display in the lower area. This area will have different fixed options and information depending on the selected Workspace Template. The remainder of the template may be freely customized by the user. Each Template can contain up to 4 Pages that can be toggling using the WorkSpace Template Keys or by tapping the yellow {VIBE} Menu key at the bottom left of each Workspace Template and tapping the {PAGES} key to the right of the {VIBE} key to open the page’s display. Each Monitor (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain its own independent set of WorkSpace Templates. Workspace Templates are organized into three familiar categories, each with a dedicated display key. These keys are found above the top left corner of the Smart Screen: PATCH [PROG] - (Program) [PLAY-B] - (Playback Controllers) The Workspace Template Keys are specific to the monitor that has focus (last touched or selected via a mouse). 4.2 VIBE Menu The {VIBE} Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped sub-menus. It is used to access common system functions such as Save and System Settings as well as configure Workspace Template displays. Vibe Menu can be opened at any time by tapping on the Vibe key in the low left corner of the screen. 4.2.1 Show Menu Open the Show Menu to access the following options. {New Show} - Starts a new show. {Save Show} - Saves the current show. {Save Show As…} - Opens a popup to name and save the current show, on Vibe or on an external device. {Load Show} - Opens a popup to load a saved show file. {Load Vector Show} - Opens a popup to load and convert a show from Compulite Vector. After selecting the Vector show file, the popup will guide you through the process of device-matching and show conversion options. Vector Shows may be loaded with the following limitations: Devices: If a matching device exists in Vibe that device will be used. Modes will be matched. If a similar device exists, it will be used. Modes will try to be matched. If no match or close match is found, a generic device will be created. Patch: Vector device parameter DMX will be mapped to Vibe parameter DMX. Qlists: Qlists will be matched. Cues and Cue Values: Matching Cues will be created with Vector cue parameter values matched to Vibe cue parameter values. Temp Cues: Temp Cues are converted to Vibe Scenes. Vector Submasters: Submasters are converted to Vibe Scene Submasters. Groups: Groups will be matched. Snaps: Snaps will be mapped with Vector physical playbacks being mapped to Vibe virtual controllers when the number of Vector Playbacks exceeds the amount of Vibe Controllers. Macros: Currently not supported. Effects: Currently not supported but under development. Vector Playbacks ⟶ Vibe Controllers: Paging is matched and all button functions common to Vector and Vibe are matched. {Clean Up Show} - Opens a popup where it is possible to check and delete the data that are not being used in the show. {Report} - Opens a popup where it is possible to create excel files with the data of the show, such as Groups, Libraries, Qlists and Scenes content. The Report file can be generated for all the data or just for the selected objects. The Reports are saved in the Reports Folder inside WorkDir. {Error Report} - Creates an Error Report file that can be shared with Compulite Support in case of software problems. 4.2.2 Layout and Views Menus Open the Layout menu to access the layout options. Open the Patch, Program and Playback Views Menus to access all the views to configure Vibe’s workspace. Learn more about configuring the workspace and layouts in the dedicated chapters. 4.2.3 Windows Menu Open the Windows menu to access the following options. Add a smart window and external windows to be placed on additional screens. Show / Hide the windows title bar to the window. Enter / Exit the full screen mode. Open the Fixture Builder’s- Open the Offline Tool Exit Vibe (main window) or Close Window (external windows) Exit Button The Exit and Close buttons are located in the Windows sub-menu.

This window is also directly accessible from the control area in the low right corner of the screen. {Network Settings} - Opens a popup to configure the Console name and IP Address, find other Vibe systems on the same Network, and create a Client based connection such as the Master / Slave. {DMX Settings} - Opens a popup to enable, disable and configure the DMX outputs and inputs ports, the network protocols such as VC’s, ArtNet and ACN, and the DMX rate. {I/O Settings} - Opens a popup to enable, disable and configure the MIDI notes, OSC commands, the Midi Show Control, and the timecode protocols such as MTC and SMPTE. {CITP Settings} - Opens a popup to enable, disable and configure the CITP settings. Learn more about configuring CITP in the dedicated chapters. 4.2.5 Version Tap the Version button to open a popup listing the installed version of Vibe software and components. 4.3 Pages Vibe has 3 types of workspace templates, organized in the Page screen. The Patch Template The Program Template The Playback Template The Page screen can be accesses by tapping Vibe Menu and then Pages on the toolbar, or by pressing the VIEW button. All the Page types can be composed with any view, independently from where the view is located in the Vibe Menu. The pages can also be switched from one type to another, as soon as one of the 4 spaces per type is available. On the Console it is recommended to set views such as the System Status and the Playback Status on the bottom of the Program and Playback pages, to have them in correspondence to the physical controllers. Home Pages Layout home page buttons are a fast recall for up to three main pages. Any page can be stored as a Home Page on the Editor Toolbar, near the VIBE menu button. To set up home pages Open the Vibe menu and press Pages button on the editor toolbar Enable Selection in the Pages view Select a Page and assign it as a Home Page on the Toolbar F1 keyboard button also switches between the three Home Pages. Clone Pages Clone layout pages for a faster building of a similar layout page. To clone a page Open the Vibe menu and press Pages button on the editor toolbar Enable Selection in the Pages view Select a Page and clone it with the button on the Toolbar 4.4 WorkSpaces 4.4.1 Basics When configuring workspaces, any object at the end of the hierarchical sub-menu can be tapped to open its object on a blank portion of the current workspace or dragged and dropped to the workspace surface. Once on the surface it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. If an object is dragged on top of another both will turn green and become one tabbed object. To edit the placement of objects, the {Lock} icon beside the {VIBE} menu key must be toggled to unlock the workspace display. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the display and allow normal usage. Some of the views have their own settings that can be accessed when layout is in edit mode, the view is selected and tapping the {Settings} button on the toolbar. 4.4.2 View Settings The views have their own settings that can be accessed when the layout is in edit mode and the view is selected, by tapping the buttons on the toolbar. 4.4.3 Toggle Scrollbar The Toggle Scrollbar button, in the scrollable views’ settings, adds or removes a scrollbar to/from the view. 4.4.4 Toggle Frame The Toggle Frame button adds or removes the frame to/from the view. 4.4.5 Frame Color Frames colors can be customized for a better graphical separation between the views. 4.4.6 Softkey Settings Any softkey view can be graphically customized by selecting it in layout edit mode and opening the settings popup with the {Settings} button on the toolbar. Softkey settings are used to change the size, font and color of the softkeys’ text and background. The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other views of the same tab, page, or to the softkey views in all the pages. The settings can also be saved as default, and it’s always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes. Some special color options are available to show color library softkeys with the softkey color either with the color or the colors that are stored in the library. The icon in the view’s header can be clicked to quickly jump to the top of the scrollable softkey views. IMAGE TO ADD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Softkeys Auto Text Color Setting The auto text color option in Softkey Settings popup automatically sets the softkey’s text color in black or white in contrast with the softkey’s background color, to make it always visible. This is useful for the color libraries if combined with the Mixed Color option. Context Options Context view can show or hide the visualized objects depending on the user’s settings or on the smart option. The Context Normal Mode filters the visualized objects according to the enabled buttons. The Context Smart Mode filters the visualized objects automatically avoiding the softkeys that are already visible in the page. 4.4.7 Single Button Settings Any softkey view can be graphically customized by selecting it in layout edit mode and opening the settings popup with the {Settings} button on the toolbar. Specific settings, such as color and text size, can be assigned to each single button. The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other single buttons of the same tab, page, or to the buttons in all the pages. The settings can also be saved as default, and it’s always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes. 4.4.8 Hide Menu The Close Menu button is an option to hide menus in menuable views, such as Topo, Live, Created fixtures, Timeline, etc. The hidden menu button can be placed wherever on the view with a long click gesture and drag. 4.5 Layouts Layouts: After all workspaces and associated pages are configured, the display configurations of the workspaces can be saved to a Layout by tapping the {VIBE} Menu and then the {LAYOUT} key. A Sub-menu will open with options to {SAVE LAYOUT}, {LOAD LAYOUT}. After configuring external monitors, a layout should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layouts remember the configuration of external monitors and a warning message will appear if the system is booted without the expected external monitor. Layout Settings Open the Vibe Menu and tap Settings to access the Layout Settings popup. From here it is possible to change the Vibe Theme, move the Taskbar to top or bottom position on all the pages, and set Default View Settings such as the Headers, the Frames and the Scrollbars. 4.6 Smart Screen The 11.6” multi-touch monitor embedded in the upper section of the Vibe console is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive bank, wheel, and parameter information. For more detail see: 8.3.4. Smart Screen 4.7 Toolbars The Editor Toolbar contains is a set of interactive Softkeys that are used to access less common commands: The Patch Toolbar contains two pages of options: Idle state toolbar Fixture selection state toolbar 4.8 Live Display Vibe has two ways to display parameter data: Live Display - Displays cue and editor data as a spreadsheet. Live Parameter Display - shows values in a table format instead of spreadsheet format. Live Display The Live Display has a number of options that may be set under the Options field: - Opens Live View Settings. (See 4.8.1.Live View Settings.) Fit - Opens column width options. Fit to Window Fit to Value Fix by Text Default Active on Stage - Only parameter columns that are selected in the editor or have values derived from the active stage look are shown. All others are hidden. Sets - Select which of the fixture sets to display. Fixture s Channel Spot s Matrix Media Server Other custom Sets if created Format - Controls what format the data is displayed in. % - Values in percentage Decimal - DMX values 0 ⟶ 255 Text - Parameter step text Text + Percentage 4.8.1 Live View Settings Live View Settings pop-up - Display Tab. Live View Scheme - Parameter columns may be freely added, removed, moved in using the Live View Scheme. Move columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings - the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt;} or {&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column forward or backwards. Move columns to the first or last column position: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings - the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt;&lt;} or {&gt;&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column first position or last position. Remove columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings - the green indicator light will turn on. Tap the {Remove} key. Dock - Locks the column scroll at the end of the parameter column that is docked. A red line will show on the live display to show the dock position. (Group By Banks and All icons in 1 cell are not implemented yet) Add Columns - Columns are added using the Banks section of the pop-up. Select a bank - All parameters for the bank will appear in the box adjacent to the banks. Select the parameter or parameters to add to the live display.  Swipe in the the parameter box to browse hidden parameters. Tap a parameter that is not already selected in green and it will be added to the end of the column list.  Parameter keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching the parameter will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. . Use the {|&lt;} or {&gt;|} {|&lt;&lt;} or {&gt;&gt;|} to position the column. Interactive Icons: Adds or removes the icon columns.  Interactive Icon keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns.. General: Global Fixture Number - Fixture’s hidden unique system number. Fixture Layer Number - Adds or removes Fixture Number column. Fixture Name - Adds or removes Fixture Name column.  Fixture # and Fixture Name are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. Live View Settings pop-up - Behavior Tab Fixture Jumping: Off Jump if needed - live display pages the display to show the selected fixtures if they are not shown on the current live page. Lowest Selection to Top - Jumps the lowest fixture number of the selection to the top of the live display. Parameter Jumping: Jumps the parameter’s column and related bank parameters to the end of the dock position. (First scrollable column). Interactive Fixture Selection: Turns on the ability to make fixture selections from the live display grids. Interactive Cell Editing: Turns on the ability to directly edit cells in the live display grid. Interactive Header selection - Currently implemented but may not be turned off. Enables parameters to be directly selected from the live display headers. Submaster Values: Show Stored Values - Dimmer parameters under the control of Group Submasters will continue to show their stored values and the icon will also be shown to indicate when the parameter is inhibited. Show Output Values - When the Submaster is pulled down, the actual dimmer output values will be shown in the live display dimmer column. 4.9 Live Parameter Display The Live Parameter Display shows values in a table format instead of spreadsheet format. There are three Live Parameter Modes: Live Parameters Live Banks Live Fixtures Live Parameter Mode is mainly used to display single parameter fixtures similar to theatrical consoles but is far more versatile. 4.9.1 Parameter Mode Unlike most theatrical consoles, parameters other than dimmer may be shown in Live Parameter Mode. Parameters visible in Live Parameter Mode are filtered using the Parameter View Settings Pop-up. Filter Parameters: Tap the icon - The Parameter View Settings pop-up will open. Tap parameters on either side to move them from one box to the other. Close the pop-up using [ENTER] or 4.9.2 Bank Mode Fixtures may also be graphically displayed by banks. Currently, three banks can be graphically viewed: Image will be implemented soon. Intensity - In the form of an illuminated disk. Position - In the form of a cursor that moves in a black rectangle representing the stage. Color - In the form of a circular color swatch - Color wheels are not currently supported. 4.9.3 Fixture Mode Graphically Displays Intensity, Position, and Color parameter icons as a single “tombstone” fixture "],["patch.html", "Chapter 5 Patch 5.1 Fixture Sets 5.2 Import Devices 5.3 Advanced Search 5.4 Create and Patch imported fixtures 5.5 Configuring Physical DMX I/0 5.6 Patching Inputs 5.7 Parking Addresses and Fixtures 5.8 Clone Fixtures 5.9 Device Replacement 5.10 DMX Output &amp; Input", " Chapter 5 Patch This chapter deals with creating and patching fixtures.

DMX Output &amp; Input 5.1 Fixture Sets Like other lighting consoles, Vibe contains an extensive Device Library with DMX parameter mapping for fixtures, media servers, and common miscellaneous devices like smoke machines. Before a device can be programmed it must be imported and patched to DMX addresses. Vibe has an advanced numbering system that allows devices to be grouped into five familiar categories called SETS. Custom SETS may also be created. Numbering in all sets may be freely changed if there are no overlapping numbers. Each Set has a unique ID. Set ID numbers: 0 = [Fixture] is a special global numbering set that must also reference one of the other sets. All devices must be assigned a Fixture number and one of the other set numbers. 1 = [Channel] is a numbering set that would normally be used for conventional single parameter devices. 2 = [SPOT] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for multi-parameter devices like moving lights. 3 = [MATRIX] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for RGB or other non-moving LED fixtures. (also useful in pixel mapping devices) 4 = [SERVER] is a numbering system used for media servers. Each SET may have Fixtures numbered from 1 ⟶ 999999 To patch a device, you must first move focus to the main monitor and press the PATCH Workspace Template key. By default, the first page will contain all the displays needed for patching. 5.1.1 Edit Sets There is an option to edit a user-created set. This is done via the Sets browser view. To Edit a Set Add a Sets browser view : Open Vibe menu Tap Patch Tap Sets On the Sets browser view select a user-created set Tap Edit 5.2 Import Devices Once the Patch Workspace is open: Make sure the {Imported Devices} tab just above the white FIXTURE selection display area at the bottom left of the workspace is selected. Tap {Import}, the Manufactures picker list will appear. Flick or drag along the list to browse to the desired manufacturer then tap the manufacturer’s name. A new list and search window will open. If the exact device name is known, type it in the search window, if not flick or drag to browse the list until the desired device is found. The &lt; key may be pressed at any time to return to the Imported Devices list. 5.3 Advanced Search Fixtures may be searched directly by name using the Advanced Device Search. Searches may also be filtered by parameter order and DMX Channel Count to limit the search. The filters are very helpful in finding close matches for fixtures that are not currently in the device library. To access Advanced Search: Tap {Import} from the main page - The tab will now read {Advanced Search}. Tap {Advanced Search} - The Advanced Search Pop-up will appear. Type the fixture’s name in the Fixture Name box or Set the filters to limit the selection. Select the fixture from under the Matching Devices header. The DMX Modes pop-up will open. Review the DMX implementation and select the desired mode. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and add the fixture to the Imported Devices list. 5.4 Create and Patch imported fixtures Import the desired device. (See 5.2. Import Devices). The device will now be in the list below the Imported Devices header. Tap the device you wish to patch and the Create and Patch Fixtures popup will appear. In the Create and Patch fixtures pop-up, type the quantity in the red highlighted field via the keypad or flick/drag to browse the list until the desired quantity number is found then tap the number. If the Quantity number is not highlighted in Red, tap the field to make it active. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap in the {SET} field. The appropriate SET for the selected fixture should automatically be selected, but as some fixtures don’t always cleanly fit into standard categories, check that the correct Set is selected. If not, flick/drag to browse to the correct SET then tap it. You may also type the Set number (0-5). Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the {Set Number} field. Set the Channel, Spot, Matrix, or Server number for the fixture in the red highlighted field using the keypad or scroll to browse the list until the desired start number is found, then tap the number.  By default, the first available number for the selected SET is pre-assigned. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any box in the Fixture Number field to select it. By default, the same number as the SET Number will appear as the Fixture Number. Many users like to group Fixtures by 10ʼs or 100ʼs so it is common to type 101 for the start of one type of fixture, 201 for a second type and so on. The SET number and Fixture number do not have to be the same. Next to the Fixture Number field is a data entry box that displays the fixture’s default short name. This may be edited at any time while in this pop-up. The name will be updated when the fixtures are created upon closing the pop-up. In the second section of the pop-up, fixtures that were selected for creation can be patched via the DMX patch wizard. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap a number in the UNIVERSE field. If the desired universe is not visible, flick/drag to browse to the correct universe number then tap it. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any number in the ADDRESS field.  By default, the interval between fixtures of the same type is fixed. Using the INTERVAL field, a custom interval may be set. To complete CREATE and PATCH tap the {APPLY &amp; CONTINUE} key in the bottom right corner of the pop-up, Press [ENTER], or tap to close the pop-up and return to the patch workspace. Theatrical Multi-Patching can also be done manually using keypad syntax: Toggle off the {MAIN PATCH} key at the top of the DMX patch wizard before closing the pop-up. The fixtures will be created but will remain unpatched. To Patch fixtures using traditional keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] [ADDRESS] [#].[#] ( By default, the first available DMX address of the selected Universe will be shown in the ADDRESS field. If the default start address is not appropriate, type or scroll the list to the desired start address and tap it.Universe.Address), [STORE]. Or [ADDRESS] [#].[#] +/ - ⟶ [#].[#] [FIXTURE] [#] [STORE].  Addresses may also be typed in absolute format: 1 ⟶ 32,768 (64U niverses standard). The system will automatically assign the correct universe.  When starting from a {New Show} only {Physical DMX outputs} are enabled. Network universes must be enabled in PATCH {DMX Settings} 5.4.1 Drag and Drop Patch Drag and Drop Patch - If {Main Patch} is toggled off in the Create and Patch pop-up, fixtures can be created but not patched. Created fixtures may then be dragged and dropped onto the Universe View. Drag and Drop from the Fixtures tab: Create fixtures - (See: 5.4. Create and patch imported fixtures). Select the Fixture Set you wish to patch from in the lower right of the main patch workspace. Select the Fixtures tab on the left side of the main patch workspace directly above the white FIXTURE selection box. A list of created fixtures will appear. Make sure the Universes View tab at the bottom of the main patch workspace is selected. Select a destination Universe from the Universes list in the top right of the main patch workspace. - Scroll the list to browse for hidden universes. Press and Hold a fixture, it will turn into a floating icon of the fixture. Drag the fixture icon from the Fixtures list onto the Universe View grid. All associated DMX addresses for the fixture will turn green. Drop the fixture icon on the desired DMX start address for the fixture. - The fixture is now patched.  Multiple fixtures may be selected by swiping ⤴ or ⤵ in the Fixtures list. Make multiple selections of fixtures using the keypad: Type a range of fixtures using the keypad - the fixture selection will be displayed numerically in the white fixture selection box. Press and Hold anywhere in the white fixture selection box - a fixture icon will appear. Drag the icon to the Universe View grid and drop it at the destination start address - the range of fixtures is now patched. Multi-Patch using Drag and Drop: Drag and drop the same fixture to multiple DMX offsets.  All types of fixtures may be multi-patched but caution should be used when multi-patching multi-parameter fixtures. Unpatch fixtures using drag and drop: Press and Hold any patched DMX offset - The DMX addresses for the fixtures patched to it will turn green and a fixture icon will be shown. Drag the selected block of fixtures towards the bottom of the screen - a waste basket icon will appear at the bottom of the workspace. Drag the block until the fixture icon is over the waste basket and release the fixture - the fixture will now be unpatched. 5.4.2 Modify Patch Once patched fixtures can be modified using keypad syntax or using the two Patch Toolbars in the Patch Workspace. Toolbar with no fixture selection: {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens up Clear Patch pop-up. {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up. {ADD FIXTURE} - Opens the Create And Patch pop-up. {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens up Delete Fixtures pop-up. Toolbar with fixture selection: [FIXTURE] [#] {PATCH} - Opens up Patch Fixture pop-up. [FIXTURE] [#] {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up with fixture already selected. [FIXTURE] [#] {FIXTURE CALIBRATION} - Opens up Fixture Calibration pop-up with the fixture selected. See: 19. XYZ Fixture Calibration [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens the Clear Patch confirmation popup [FIXTURE] [#] {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens the Delete Fixture confirmation pop-up Modify the patch using keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - From the Editor toolbar. [FIXTURE] [#] [DELETE] - Only works in the Patch Workspace. 5.4.3 Address Test Sometimes, especially in theater environments, it is useful to check if a DMX channel is empty or not. This can be done from the console by enabling the Address Test function on the header of the Universe View. In Address Test mode each selected channel is visualized with a yellow background and it is forced to jump at full intensity. Once the function is disabled all the channels come back to their normal state. 5.5 Configuring Physical DMX I/0 By default, DMX is mapped to the physical ports on a 1:1 basis. DMX is always transmitted but can be remapped to anyone of the supported 256 DMX universes. Remap Physical outputs: Open the {DMX SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the DMX Settings button - The DMX Properties pop-up will open. In the Protocol column, Tap {Physical output}. Under the Source Universe heading, tap the desired source universe number or once red type the universe number you wish to be the source. Under the Physical output Destination Universe heading, tap one of the 8 displayed physical outputs - the source Universe will now be patched to the output. Change output to input - Currently, Vibe supports 2 inputs but multiple connectors may be assigned to the same input. Tap a patched output - Two additional options will appear below the Output Destination Universe box. {Make Input 1} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 1. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. {Make Input 2} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 2. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. Change input back to output: Tap a patched input - an additional Make Output option will appear below the Output Destination Universe box. Tap {Make Output} - The Connector will now output DMX. Change DMX refresh rate: ◾ Vibe will aways transmit DMX at the fastest refresh rate it can (38 - 44Hz). Sometimes older equipment cannot handle the high refresh rate, so it may be reduced using the DMX Max Rate wheel. It is not recommended to go below 28Hz as some jitter may be observed. 5.6 Patching Inputs The following objects may be mapped to DMX inputs: DMX input mapped directly to the console’s DMX outputs DMX input mapped to Macros DMX input mapped to Controllers DMX input mapped to fixtures Map a DMX output to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [ADDRESS] [#] Press [STORE] E.g. [ADDRESS] [1] {INPUT PATCH TO} [ADDRESS] [1] [STORE] - When DMX 1 is received from an external source like a console, DMX 1 will directly output to the Vibes DMX output. No values will be shown in the live display as no actual parameters are involved. Map a range of DMX outputs to a range of DMX inputs: Press [ADDRESS] [#] ⟶ [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [ADDRESS] [#] ⟶ [#] Press [STORE] Map a Macro to a DMX input - Macro will trigger at 50% Press [ADDRESS] [#].[#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [MACRO] [#] Press [STORE] Map a controller to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [PLAY-B] (Controller) - The Controller Selection pop-up will appear. Choose the Controller Type, Page Number, and Controller number from the pop-up. Press ENTER, or tap to close the pop-up and complete the patch. Map a Fixture to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [Fixture] [#] Press [STORE] DMX inputs will automatically be mapped to all the fixtures parameters starting at the specified address. [ADDRESS] [1] [FIXTURE] [1] (A fixture with 42 parameters) [STORE] will automatically match the 42 parameters to input addresses 1 → 42. The next fixture would have to be mapped starting at address 43. Delete a DMX Input patch assignment: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [DELETE] 5.7 Parking Addresses and Fixtures Park an Address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park pop-up will appear. Set a DMX level from 0 ⟶ 255 using tee virtual slider. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and park the address. Unpark and address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park pop-up will appear. Tap {Clear Park}. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and unpark the address. Park a fixture: [FIXTURE] [#] - Set parameter values in the editor. Tap {PARK} on the editor toolbar. Press [STORE] - Fixture will now be parked at the editor values. Unpark a fixture: [FIXTURE] [#] {PARK} [DELETE] View parked fixtures and address: See: 17.2. Patch Exam &gt; The Grandmaster does not affect parked addresses and fixtures. The [B.O.] key will blackout parked addresses and fixtures. 5.8 Clone Fixtures Vibe has smart and advanced clone features. The Fixture Cloning feature allows to copy all the stored data from a selection of fixtures to another one. To open the fixture cloning popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page’s Editor Toolbar. Choose the order of source fixtures on the left column and the order of destination fixtures on the right column, then press Done. Vibe will provide a smart fixture cloning keeping the fixtures’ data as similar as possible. Selection Rules: All source fixtures must be of the same type. All destination fixtures must be of the same type. Many fixtures can be cloned to many fixtures, but the amount must be the same. It is possible to select 1 source and many destinations. The fixture cloning operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button. Exchange Clone The Cloning option on the top can be set as a one sided or a two-sided clone. A one-sided clone copies the stored data from the source to the destination fixtures only. A two-sided clone, called Exchange Clone, makes a smart replacement of data from the source fixtures to the destination fixtures and vice versa. Advanced Clone The Advanced fixture cloning option on the top enables access to a pair of Next popup windows where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced, and customized by the user. The next step shows the Parameter Selection window. The cloning can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters’ levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture’s functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart. On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart. The next step shows the Data window. The Data window permits to filter the Groups, Libraries, Qlists, Scenes and Submasters, to apply the cloning only to the selected contents. Default is that all are selected. NOTE: on the exchange option, these lists will show objects from both source and destination fixtures. There is an option to clone the calibration data, so the destination fixture will get the same location coordinates as the source fixture. Default is Disabled, because in real world 2 fixtures cannot have the same physical position, but can be enabled, for example in case of fixture switches or if working on a 3D visualizer trying different lighting setups on the same rig. There is an option to clone the look ahead mask so if the source fixture is in the mask, then the destination fixtures will also be in the mask. Default is Enabled. There is an option to choose what to do with the parameters of the destination fixtures that are not included in the clone because they were not matched or any other reason. Merge means to keep these values, overwrite will delete the values. Default is Overwrite. 5.9 Device Replacement Vibe has smart and advanced device replacement. The Device replacement feature allows to replace a device with another one, keeping all the matching data stored. To open the device replacement popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page’s Editor Toolbar. Choose the Source device on the left column and the new device from the Imported Devices on the right column, then press Done. Vibe will provide a smart device replacement keeping the fixtures’ data as similar as possible. The device replacement operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button. Advanced Replacement The Advanced replacement option on the top enables access to a Next popup window where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced and customized by the user. The next step shows the Parameter Selection window. Each bank has its option to enable/disable. Enabled means it will be included in the Device replacement and disabled means it will not be included. Default is enabled. The replacement can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters’ levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture’s functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart. On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart. 5.10 DMX Output &amp; Input DMX Output and DMX Input views are meant to show in real time the output and input values of each DMX channel of the selected universe. DMX values can be shown in numeric or in graphic visualization. "],["system-settings.html", "Chapter 6 System Settings 6.1 Editing 6.2 Timing 6.3 Hardware 6.4 Defaults 6.5 System", " Chapter 6 System Settings This chapter deals with customizing system settings to suit programming styles. The following is covered in this chapter: 6.1. Editing 6.2. Timing 6.3. Hardware 6.4. Defaults 6.5. System 6.1 Editing System Settings defaults are accessed by selecting {System Settings} from the {Vibe} menu or by tapping the {System Status} area at the far right side of the controller displays. Editing Properties - Editing Section Default Stage Value: Home Value - When released, fixtures parameters will return to their home values as specified in the device’s definition or user Home Scene. Maintain Last Value - When released, fixture parameters will remain at their current position but dimmer will go out. Auto Parameter Grouping: When on, parameters are grouped as follows: Clear Editor After Store: Default editor behavior when in Compulite Mode - After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until [RESET] or [VIBE]+[RESET] is pressed. Editor Flash: Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature. {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values) Defaults - {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%) Apply Compulite Mode: - Sets a number of defaults to emulate traditional nontracking Compulite Mode. Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value} {Clear Editor After Store} = Off {Advance To Cue After Store} = Off Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking} Editing Properties: - Cueing Section Tracking - Non-Tracking: Tracking On: ◾ Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values. Non-Tracking: ◾ Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero. In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the Store Options {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors. Clear Editor on Master GO: The editor will be reset when GO on the Master Controller is pressed. Store Scene by Default: By default [STORE] [HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue. Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax [STORE] [CUE] [HERE] (press any controller button). Next Cue Increment: When [Store] [Here], [STORE] [STORE], or [STORE] [ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used. E.g. If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20. Editing Properties: - ON Value Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the [ON] key is pressed. {First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing [ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default. Restore and Save Defaults: {Restore Popup Positions} - Currently redundant. {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set. {Restore Factory} - Restores console to “read only” defaults. {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to show specific defaults without exiting the pop-up. 6.2 Timing Timing Properties - Cue Section Default Back Time: Timing is used when the [Back] or [Hold Back] Buttons are pressed. Default Assert: Timing is used when a controller’s parameters are reasserted with the [ASSERT] [HERE] command. Use Cue Time - As the Assert command is basically a GOTO command to the same cue that is active, the cue time for the cue being reasserted may be used instead of the Default Assert time. Default GOTO Time: Default timing when the GOTO command is used. GOTO time can be overridden using command [GOTO] [CUE] [#] [TIME] [Value]Press or [ENTER]. Default Release Time: Default Fade out time for parameters being released from the editor using the [RESET], parameter [RELEASE] keys, or Controllers being released from the stage (turned off) using the controller [RELEASE] button. Look Ahead Section: Set all controllers on will enable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Set all controllers off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Once all is set on, individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time. Once all off, individual controllers may be enabled Look Ahead at any time. Timing Properties - Snap Section: Default fade time for all controllers being initiated by the Snap. Timing Properties - System Time Section: System Time (Editor Time) is applied to values being introduced into the editor and other miscellaneous features that do not otherwise have their own timing settings. 6.3 Hardware Hardware Properties - Panel Backlight Inactive keys: Adjusts the LED backlight level of keys that are not valid in the current operational state. Adjusts the LED backlight level of controllers that are unassigned. Active Keys: Adjusts the LED backlight level of keys that may be used in the current operational state.

Prevent from Paging - Locks a Qlist or Scene to the current page. Paging ⤴ or ⤵ will not affect the Qlist or Scene on the controller. Prevent from Grab - The Grab command will not capture the controller’s active parameters. Defaults - Controller Settings: Priority Virtual Priority Wheel - Sets the controller’s LTP group number. Controllers assigned higher numbers cannot be overridden by lower numbers. Controllers assigned the same number will be LTP among themselves. Values may be entered using the virtual wheel or directly by taping the middle of the centre area of the wheel and typing a value from the keypad. Defaults - Controller Settings: Restore defaults Restores settings - Resets Controller settings to their last stored configuration. 6.4.2 Controller Actions Defaults - Controller Default Actions Qlists and Scenes: The Default button assignments when a Qlist or Scene is assigned to a controller ( See: 13.5. Configuring Controllers) Bottom Controller Button for Submaster The default behavior for submaster’s assignment on the bottom button is Flash Submasters (Group Submasters) - When a Scene is configured as a Submaster it has a unique set of functions and button options. 6.4.3 Qlist Properties Defaults - Qlist Properties Qlist Mode: Normal - Cues do not auto loop and all normal time functions are calculated. Chaser - Cues auto-loop from one to another. Only In-Time, and Delay-In Time are calculated. Parameter time is still valid. Qlist Direction: Backward - Chasers and Qlists transition highest to lowest. Forward - Chases and Qlists transition lowest to highest. Tracking (Default): ON - Normal tracking logic will be used.

"],["programming-concepts.html", "Chapter 7 Programming Concepts 7.1 Operational Philosophy 7.2 Command Syntax 7.3 Command Line", " Chapter 7 Programming Concepts This chapter deals with Vibe programming philosophy, command line behavior, and syntax conventions. The following is covered in this chapter: 7.1. Operational Philosophy 7.2. Command Syntax 7.3. Command Line 7.1 Operational Philosophy The Vibe is an advanced lighting control system designed to simplify programming in all styles of Entertainment lighting. Abstraction: To simplify programming, Vibe uses an abstract layer that allows fixtures of different hardware types to be presented to the user in a universal way. The dedicated graphical “Smart Screen” presents global pickers for most parameters including: HSV color picker (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) P/T XYZ Trackpad Blade picker Beam picker for Iris, Zoom, Focus and Frost effects General slider picker for GOBO, Color, Prism, and Animation wheels Intensity picker for common intensity values and strobe effects Real World Units: Where possible picker values are displayed in “Real World” units XYZ P/T in degrees Strobe in HZ Color in HSV 0-360 degrees Zoom in degrees Virtual Parameters: To make it easier to work with fixtures using different color systems and XYZ tracking systems, Vibe creates virtual parameters that may not exist in the physical fixture. Examples would be: HSV - As a common denominator for CMY, RGB, and Multi color LED fixtures such as RGBA, ETC Seven color, RGBW. Virtual Intensity - For controlling LED fixtures that do not have a dimmer parameter. XYZ - for calibration of fixtures that only have a physical Pan/Tilt Tracking: Vibe by default is a Tracking console and follows the conventions of modern theatrical consoles. Vibe also has a special track feature called SKIP. If cues are modified using SKIP, instead of Qonly, the relationship with the original hard value is maintained, and changes to the original value “Skip” over the modification and preserve the track. Qonly Mode: Not implemented globally Modifications, insertions and deletions will be done Qonly by default Move fades will still be valid Non - Tracking Compulite Mode - Defaults are changed to: Tracking turned off. The Editor is not cleared after a Store. After Reset, Editor values remain at their last position instead of returning to home values. (Compulite Gray tracking) Controllers do not advance after a Store. Color spaces: The Vibe can work in three color spaces: HSV - Color for all types of fixtures can be set using the Color picker or the HSV parameter wheels. HSV virtual parameters are stored in Cues and Libraries just like physical parameters. Automatically CMY or RGB values (depending on the fixture type) will be displayed but not directly referenced in cues using HSV. RGB - If color values are set using the physical RGB parameters, those values are stored in the cue and HSV values will be displayed but not directly referenced . CMY - If color values are set using the CMY parameters, those values are stored in the cue and HSV values will be displayed but not directly referenced. Color crossfading: Currently, color crossfading is done using the physical color parameters. In future release it will be possible to crossfade HSV using predefined vectors Maintain Selection: To avoid constantly reselecting fixtures after a STORE command, Vibe maintains its selection on reset of the editor. To clear the editor and selection, [VIBE] (Shift) + [RESET] must be pressed. 7.2 Command Syntax Vibe uses a hybrid command syntax. When dealing with keypad command line driven operations, the logic is: Source Objects ⟶ Filters ⟶ Options ⟶ Command Completes. (Action Completes Mode) e.g. [Group 1] [Full] [Library 2 (Position) 1] [Enter] [Cue 1] [Store Options] {Red + White} [Store] For softkeys and controllers where touching the object completes the sequence, the logic is: Source Object, Filter, Command, Options, Destination Object Completes (Here Mode) Completes {GROUP} [1][Full], [LIBRARY] {Position} [3] [Store] [Store Options] {Red Only} [Press any [Button] on Slider Controller 1]. 7.3 Command Line The Command Line is the area where commands appear as they are entered. When in Live it is bounded in grey on the big monitor and blue on the small monitor. When in BLIND, both command lines are bounded in yellow. Commands may be backspaced using the Clear Entry [CE] key, The command line can be clear back to the beginning using the [CLEAR] key ([VIBE]+[CE]) Command are also augmented with the interactive toolbar beside the command line on the big screen.

Blind Editor 8.1.1 What is the Editor All manual parameter modification occurs in the EDITOR. (Programmer in some other consoles). The Live Displays show all values from both Controller outputs (Playbacks or Executors on some consoles) and fixtures in the Editor. Color coding is used to distinguish between values coming from the controllers and values in the EDITOR. Home a fixture in the Editor: [FIXTURE] [#] [HOME] Home a fixture parameter in the Editor: [FIXTURE] [#] {BANK} {PARAMETER} [HOME] Release a fixture in the Editor: [FIXTURE] [#] RELEASE] Release a fixture parameter in the Editor: [FIXTURE] [#] {BANK} {PARAMETER} [RELEASE] Reset (Clear) the Editor: Press [RESET] key Reset (Clear) the Editor and clear the selection: Press [VIBE] + [RESET] See also: 8.3.10. Release and Home Sequences 8.1.2 Blind Editor The Blind Editor is used to create or modify objects without outputting values to the stage Vibe has two Blind Editor behaviors: Blind acts as a discrete editor separate from the live editor Blind emulates the behavior of single editor consoles where the main editors output is just disabled To build a new cue in the Blind Editor: Press [Blind] key flashes yellow and the Command Line turns yellow.

Remainder Dim {Rem Dim} 8.2.8 Home Scene 8.2.1 Selections Tools Currently, Vibe has basic Selection Tools. Advanced tools are under development. {ODDS} - Absolute odd number in the range {Evens} - Absolute even numbers in the range {2/1} - Grouping of 2 starting at the first fixture of the range (Relative odd numbers) {2/2} - Grouping of 2 starting at the second fixture of the range (relative even numbers) {3/1} - Grouping of 3 starting at the first fixture of the range {4/1} - Grouping of 4 starting at the first fixture of the range {/} - Used as a separator. Groupings of #/# Start fixture of the grouping E.g. - [Fixture] [1] [⟶ ] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [1] - would select fixtures 1,4,7,10,13 (as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/1 will be displayed on the command line). [Fixture] [1] [⟶ ] [14] {Section Tools} [3] {/} [2] - would select fixtures 2,5,8,11,14 (as soon as the {/} is pressed EVERY 3/2 will be displayed on the command line). 8.2.2 Transpose Transpose is accessed from the Editor Toolbar. It is used to reorder fixture selection based on a specified offset. This is particularly useful in creating interesting effects and fanning. E.g. 1: - Fixture 1 ⟶ 12 {Transpose} 2 [ENTER] = 1+3+5+7+9+11+2+4+6+8+10+12 E.g. 2: - Fixture 1 ⟶ 12 {Transpose} 3 [ENTER] = 1+4+7+10+2+5+8+11+3+6+9+12 E.g. 3: - Fixture 1⟶ 12 {Transpose} 4 [ENTER] = 1+5+9+2+6+10+3+7+11+4+8+12 8.2.3 Order and Selection {#Order and Selection-8.2.3.} Order The Order button allows to make changes to the fixtures’ selection order. Press ORDER on Program and Playback pages’ toolbar to access the features. IMAGE TO ADD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Press RESTORE to get back to the original selection order. Press PATTERN to access the Pattern popup, with more advanced reordering tools. Press the CE/CLEAR button to return to the upper toolbar’s menu. Selection The Selection button allows to split the fixtures’ selection. Press SELECTION on Prog and Play pages’ toolbar to access the features. IMAGE TO ADD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Press RESTORE to get back to the original selection. Press LOCK to make the current selection as the new base selection. Press the CE/CLEAR button to return to the upper toolbar’s menu. Pattern: Pattern feature is accessed from the Editor Toolbar. It can be used prior to entering the Advanced Effects editor to create more complex block patterns that are available using the basic {Block Of} and {Sub-Block Of} key in the effects editor. Pattern popup is used to edit the selection order through smart functions and a graphical interface. Make a fixture selection Tap {Pattern} on the Editor Toolbar - The Pattern pop-up will open.  This is not an effect even though it is a dynamic display. Tap the indicator at the top of the displayed fixtures. - it should turn white. Select a number under the Block Size header. Tap the {Spread} icon. The fixture columns will expand to show the new fixture order. If desired make further order changes under the Offset Header and tap {offset} icon. Make further modifications or reset the selection with the {Reset} {Invert} {transpose} and {Invert Columns} keys. Once finished, exit the pop-up by pressing or [ENTER]. Open the Advanced Effects editor and program the desired effect. See: 12.3. Advanced Effects Editor Simple Block and Sub Block groupings may be created within both Effects Editors. The pattern is for advanced blocks and groupings 8.2.4 Fan Mode Vibe has two methods to fan fixture parameters: Using the [Fan] key and interface. Using keypad syntax. See: 8.3.7. Fixture Selection (Detailed) Using [Fan] Mode: Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode. Select a Function from the sliding picker. Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode. Selecting a different parameter will also turn Fan mode off. Common Fan Functions are : {Fade In} / = lowest to highest {Fade Out}  = highest to lowest {Diagonal} -/- = Standard PAN Fan {Saw Tooth} / = Mirror lowest on ends to highest in middle {Mirror} / = Highest on ends to lowest in middle Function types may be freely changes while in Fan Mode to “audition” various results. Any Function created in the Function Editor of the Advanced Effect Editor may be applied to Fan Block of and Sub Blocks: Select the range of fixtures to be fanned. Press [FAN] to enter Fan Mode. Select a Function from the sliding picker. Select Blocks of {#} Select Sub Blocks {#} Turn the encoder wheel of the parameter requiring fanning. Toggle [FAN] to turn off Fan Mode. Examples of Blocks and Sub Blocks: {Fade In} - Blocks of 1 and no Sub Block {Fade In} - Blocks of 4 no Sub Blocks {Fade In} - Blocks of 6, Sub Blocks of 2 {Saw Tooth} - (Low-High Mirror) Blocks of 12, Sub Blocks 2 Moving Light Fixture with {Fade In} Dimmer and Color Fan, and {Diagonal} Pan Fan Instead of fanning Blocks based on the selection, fixture Groups may also be used as Blocks. To Fan Blocks By Groups: Using the Group SKs or using the keypad, select the Groups to be fanned Tap {Blocks By Group} Use any of the above methods to fan parameters by Group Parameters may also be fanned using keypad syntax. Fixture Selection (Detailed) 8.2.5 Highlight Mode Highlight and Lowlight modes are used to help identify the positions of fixtures so that they may be edited more easily. Highlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - Full Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked To Highlight fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using keypad or using Groups. Press [H.LIGHT] - The key will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will remain “highlighted” and all other fixtures will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [H.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. Highlight/Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection To swap new fixtures into Highlight: Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped. Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection. Highlight may be customized when the default home values are too generic. Users may want to tighten the zoom or use a specific iris as a fixtures default. To create a custom Highlight Scene: Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [STORE] The Highlight Scene only affects the active fixture. To Delete the Highlight Scene: Press [SCENE] [H.LIGHT] [DELETE] 8.2.6 Lowlight Mode Lowlight mode is used when many fixtures are lit up and therefore Highlight is not helpful. Lowlight Mode affects parameters and banks in the following way: Dimmer - 30% all fixtures except active fixture which will be at 100% Other Intensity parameters - home values and masked. Position - unchanged and editable Color - home values and masked Beam - home values and masked Image - home values and masked Shape - home values and masked Unlike Highlight, Lowlight maintains a value of 30% for dimmers while active. To “Lowlight” fixtures or Groups: Select fixtures using the keypad or using Groups. Press [L.LIGHT] - All dimmer parameters will go to 30%. [L.LIGHT] will flash in red to indicate the mode is active. All other fixtures of the selection will be set as specified above. Press [NEXT] - The first fixture will go to a dimmer value of 100% and all other fixtures dimmer values will remain at 30%. Other parameters will return to their editor or stage values. Adjust Pan/Tilt as required and press [NEXT] to move to the next fixture. Continue through the fixture selection using [NEXT] [PREV] until all fixtures are focused. Press [L.LIGHT] again to turn off Highlight Mode. The red light will go out and fixtures will return to their current editor or stage values. Highlight/Lowlight may be entered before a selection is made. Press [ENTER] to Highlight the selection. To swap new fixtures into Lowlight: Select new fixtures or Groups and press [ENTER] while still in Highlight Mode - the Highlight selection will be swapped. &gt;Until [NEXT] [PREV] is pressed Groups will be appended to make up a larger Highlight selection. Lowlight may be customized when the default home values are are too generic. Frequently users set the Lowlight dimmer to Zero instead of the default 30% to create a solo effect. To create a custom Lowlight Scene: Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene. Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [STORE] To Delete the Highlight Scene: Press [SCENE] [L.LIGHT] [DELETE] 8.2.7 Remainder Dim REM DIM is an Editor Tool commonly used in theatr environments but can be useful in many other situations. {REM DIM} Toggles all dimmer values to 0 except those that are selected. If no value is given in the editor, the selected fixtures will maintain their current values and not create a hard move. While in {REM DIM}, [Next]/[Prev] will swap the Rem Dim fixture forwards or backwards. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made followed by {REM DIM} all unselected fixtures will go to 0. The selected fixtures will not be changed or entered into the editor. If a selection of multiple fixtures is made, [Next]/[Prev] will force all but the first fixture in the selection to 0. The next press of [Next]/[Prev] will force the first fixture to 0 and release the next fixture. Fixtures in the selection will continue to swap from 0 to release with each press of [Next]/[Prev]. Pressing REM DIM again toggles the feature off and restores the stage look. Cues may be stored with {REM DIM} on but once stored, {REM DIM} is turned off. 8.2.8 Home Scene By default released fixtures return to their home values as defined by the device’s fixture profile. The device profile is usually based on the manufacturer’s suggested defaults, but sometimes the defaults are not appropriate. Vibe allows users to customize Home Values by building a Home Scene. When a fixture is programmed in a Home Scene it will take preference over its home values in the device profile. Create a Home Scene: Program fixtures in the editor to values that will work best as home values. Press [SCENE] [HOME] [STORE] - When released fixtures will now use the Home Scene as a reference. Delete a Home Scene: Press [SCENE] [HOME] [DELETE] - Home values will return to the device profile’s home values. 8.3 Working with Fixtures Working with Fixtures: 8.3.1.

Fixture Selection (Detailed) 8.3.8. Setting Parameters using Main Encoder Wheels 8.3.9. Setting Parameters using Interactive Encoder Wheels 8.3.10. Release and Home Sequences 8.3.1 Fixture Selection basics Fixtures are selected using the [FIXTURE] key on the keypad. They also may be stored and recalled using the [GROUP] key. Fixtures may also be interactively selected via the Live Display or Live Parameter Display. [+] [-] ⟶ keys are valid with Fixture selections and Groups. [FIXTURE] ◾ (period) - Reselects the last selection. [FIXTURE] ⟶ - Reselects all fixtures in the Editor. [CE] - Backspaces the command line one character at a time but currently will not go back one command at a time. [VIBE]+[CE/CLEAR] - Clears the command line to the beginning and ideal tee system. [RELEASE]: ◾ First press releases the active parameters (last adjusted) for selected fixtures. ◾ Second press releases all remaining parameters for selected fixtures from the Editor. [DE SEL] - Deselects all fixtures but maintains values in the Editor. This function is usually used to protect the operator from accidentally adjusting parameters in the Editor when they are temporarily captured. It may also be used to “idle” the command line to allow [TEXT] {SK} function while fixtures are still in the Editor. [RESET] - Releases all parameters from the Editor. [VIBE]+[RESET] - Releases all parameters from the Editor and releases all selected fixtures. [NEXT]/ [PREV] - Increments or decrements fixtures in a selection. When used with a Group, will be confined to the fixtures in the Group. [VIBE]+[NEXT]/ [PREV] - Increments or decrements fixtures in a selection, keeping the fixtures’ amount and distance. Trackball [X LOCK] / [Y LOCK] - Locks the X or Y axis of the trackball. [RES] - Sets global encoder resolution. Blue = Low 8 bit, Green = Medium 10 bit (Default) red = High 16 bit. Holding the [VIBE] key down while turning an encoder temporarily sets the encoder to high resolution 16 bit. Vibe uses a precision algorithm for encoders. Based on the starting resolution, the slower an encoder is turned, the more resolution it has. 8.3.2 What are Parameters Parameters are any features of a device that may be manipulated and stored in an object. Examples of parameters would be: Dimmer Pan/Tilt Cyan/Yellow/Magenta Zoom Gobo 1 Blade Rotate In Vibe parameters are organized under six standard Banks and one special Bank: Intensity Position Color Beam Image Shape Control - A special bank as its parameters are not stored in cues. Instead it sends “real time” messages to fixtures control functions. Media The switch between banks can be done either from the touch screen or through the combination SHIFT + # where the # represents the bank number. Parameter values may be set using either Vibe’s intuitive Smart Screen picker system or conventional parameter wheels and keypad method. 8.3.3 Virtual Parameters See: 7.1. Virtual Parameters 8.3.4 Smart Screen The 11.6” multi-touch monitor directly above the 4 encoder wheels is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying: Context sensitive interactive bank, and parameter information. Encoder wheel displays. Playback information for the controllers that are directly above it. Special pop-ups for Libraries, Store options and Grab functions. A simplified Effects editor. Displays for Fan feature. The Bank buttons on the Smart Screen, used to access the different parameters of the selected fixtures, have the following behavior: - Bank buttons 1-6 are always enabled. (i.e., to access libraries in the Context view) - If the Bank is enabled and active (there are parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has White text. - If the Bank is enabled and inactive (there are no parameters for the current selection in this bank), it has Black text. - If the Bank is disabled (not functional in the current selection), it is grayed out and not accessible. - If the Bank is currently selected, it has a colored background. The Smart Screen is divided into six sections: Intensity Intensity bank has parameters like Dimmer, Shutter and Strobe. The dimmer level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the predefined incremental steps. The strobe and shutter level, mode and frequency can be set in the smart screen with the macros showing the selected fixtures’ properties. Smart Screen - Intensity Bank The Context sensitive area changes depending on the bank and fixture type. Where possible, similar parameters from different fixture types will be presented to the user using Vibe’s universal fixture model. This means that is not necessary to memorize the manufacturer’s specification of each fixture, as all fixtures are programmed in a similar consistent way. Position Position bank has parameters like Pan and Tilt. The fixtures’ position can be set either with the editor keys, wheels, and trackball, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the position picker. The position is calculated at the same time on Pan/Tilt values and on virtual XYZ values, based on the fixture’s calibration on the stage. Independently from the fixture’s pan and tilt range, the virtual XYZ coordinates allow easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different pan and tilt range, the XYZ values will automatically recover the positions. Smart Screen - Position Bank Color Color bank has parameters like Color Mix (RGB, CMY, RGBW, …) and Color Wheels. The color level can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders in “Params” screen, the color picker in “Virtual” screen, or the color presets. The color mix is calculated at the same time on the color values and on virtual HSI values, based on the fixture’s color mixing system. Independently from the fixture’s color mixing system, the color picker based on HSI system allows easy interchangeable operations between different kinds of fixtures. In case of exchange with a fixture using a different color mixing system, the virtual HSI values will automatically recover the fixture’s colors. The color wheels are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the image picker to get complete control on the wheels’ features. The color mix can also be set by using the predefined preset combinations and Vibe’s smart features. Smart Screen - Color Bank Lee and Rosco Picker Color bank has a Lee and a Rosco section to assign colors based on the most used brands of gel filters. Kelvin Picker Color bank has a Kelvin picker for a fast adjust of any color temperature between 1000K and 20000K, linearly or by incremental steps. This feature is recommended for working in television studios and photography environments. Vibe Mood Picker Color bank has a Vibe mood picker for a fast reproduction of a color taken from a picture. This feature is recommended if working with assigned color palettes, for example in cinema or theater shows, to create color libraries directly from the scene’s and costumes’ pictures. To get a color from an image Load an image file to the Vibe mood picker Zoom the section of the target color Select the color to assign to the fixture selection Beam Beam bank has parameters like Focus, Zoom, Frost and Prism. The beam parameters can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the beam picker. The beam picker automatically enables the features available on the selected fixtures, offering an intuitive control system to set the mode, speed and type of transition related to the controlled parameter. The prisms are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the wheel picker to get complete control on the prism wheels’ features. Smart Screen - Beam Bank Image Image bank has parameters like Gobo and Effect wheel. The image parameters can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the image picker. The gobo wheels are visualized in the interactive wheel picker on the right and can be selected with a touch. The selection opens the image picker to get complete control on the wheels’ features. The image picker can be also accessed by pressing the Virtual button on image bank’s screen. On the image picker’s right side, it is possible to visualize and select each fixture’s wheel, on the left side can be set the indexing and rotation speed of the whole wheel or the single frame. The interactive wheel picker shows all the graphic frames related to the selected wheel to allow fast interchange operations. Smart Screen - Image Bank Shape Shape bank has parameters like Blade movement and rotation. The blades’ depth and angle can be set either with the editor keys and wheels, and through the smart screen by using the virtual sliders and the blade picker. The blade picker features a smart graphic control of the blade, independently from the fixture’s blade system. Each blade can be moved, angled, and individually reset, the blade system can be rotated all together, and the reset options permit to reset the whole system or just the rotation parameter. Smart Screen - Shape Bank Control Control bank has parameters related to the fixture’s functions, like Lamp on/off and Reset. The control bank is a special bank as its parameters are not stored in cues. Instead it sends “real time” messages to fixtures control functions. Smart Screen - Control Media Media bank is the bank designed for an intuitive media server programming. See the dedicated Chapter 22 - Media Servers. Command Line The Smart Screen command line shows the active fixture selection. Smart Screen Preferences: Settings: Home - Returns menus to Settings level. Format - Sets the view format for wheel displays. Percent Decimal Text Text + Percent Resolution - Sets the Global wheel resolution. This may also be set by toggling the [Res] key over the trackball 8 bit - Blue on [Res] Key 10 bit - Green on [Res] key 12 bit - Red on [Res] key 16 bit - Yellow on [Res] key 24 bit - Magenta on [Res] key View - Sets behavior of smart screen views. Auto - Shows programming display when there are fixtures in the editor, and shows the controller displays for Aux Qkeys and Global Sliders when the editor is cleared. Programming - Maintains the programming display even with the editor released. Playbacks - Maintains the playback controller display even with fixtures in the editor. Wheels and wheel displays remain accessible. Wheel Picker Display Modes: Smart - All wheels for the selected fixture are shown in the interactive wheel picker area. Parameter Steps - Pressing a parameter wheel or tapping the wheel display above it will display a picker list of all feature steps for the selected fixture. Extra Wheels - Displays wheel information for the additional context sensitive encoder wheels Smart Screen Effects Editor - See: 12.2. Smart Screen Effects Editor 8.3.5 Adjusting Parameters using the Wheel Picker Smart Screen Picker Programming To adjust fixture wheel parameter values: (Interactive Wheel Picker method) Select the fixtures to program Swipe or Drag the Wheel Picker on the right-hand side of the Smart Screen and browse to the wheel and slot you want to program. Common wheels are: Color Wheel Static Gobo Wheel Rotating Gobo Wheel Animation Wheel Prism Wheel Tap the wheel slot you wish to program and the context sensitive area or the Smart Screen will open with the appropriate picker. Adjust the virtual controls as needed. Most virtual controls are also mapped to the 4 physical wheels To adjust parameter values: (standard programming method) Select the fixtures to program. Tap the {BANK} key of the parameter you wish to adjust. Banks may contain more than 4 wheels of parameters. Tapping the desired {BANK} key again, pages to the next set of 4 parameter wheels. The Assigned parameter wheel function is displayed on the Wheel Display at the bottom of the Smart Screen directly above the wheels. Rotate the large push wheel encoder of the parameter you wish to adjust. Values may be added directly from the keypad by: Pushing a parameter wheel downward to select the parameter. AT will appear on the command line Type a value from Zero ⟶ Full. @ is only used for the dimmer parameter. A Parameter value must be entered in 2 digits or one digit and the [Enter] key for whole numbers. E.g. 05, 50, 5 [ENTER] =50. 8.3.6 Grab Grab is a powerful tool for selecting fixtures that meet a number of conditions. By default GRAB selects all fixtures with intensity or virtual intensity values above Zero Pressing GRAB without a selection opens up a pop-up on the Smart Screen. It contains the following options: {Filters}: {Stage} - Select anything that is live on the stage and meets the conditions below. {Editor} -Select anything that is in the Editor and meets the conditions below. {Master Controller} (Playback) - Selects only fixtures on the Master Controller that meet the conditions. {Conditions}: {All Fixtures} - Selects all fixtures that have any changes via the editor. {Active} - fixture has intensity value over zero. {Invisible} - recorded “hard” parameter values for fixtures that do NOT have an intensity value over zero. {Inactive} (fixtures that have NO recorded values). {Parameter Selection}: {All for Selected} Grabs all parameters for selected fixtures (shortcut is [VIBE]+GRAB) {Active (ENTER)} Select all “Active” fixtures and enters them into the Editor. (Shortcut is GRAB + [ENTER]) {Search &amp; Replace}. [SET] GRAB selects all active fixtures filtered by set (Fixture/Channel/Spot/Matrix/Server/Custom) To Selectively Grab a Controller: Press GRAB - Grab Options pop-up will open Press any Slider/Qkey/Aux Qkey controller button - All fixtures that are in the Controller’s active cue and have dimmer levels above Zero (or meet the Grab conditions selected in the pop-up), will be selected. Pressing ENTER will put the selection in the EDITOR. Grab Fixtures in a cue based on a {Library} SK selection: Press GRAB tap a {Library} SK - All fixtures with matching libraries will be selected Tap another {Library} SK - The Library will be swapped to the new library This is especially useful for quickly swapping colors in cues containing libraries Select all parameters for a fixture selection: Select the fixtures Press [VIBE]+GRAB Select all Parameters with hard and tracked values outputting to the stage: Press GRAB [ENTER] 8.3.7 Fixture Selection (Detailed) FIn this guide, FIXTURE will be the default SET but any SET (Channel, Spot, Matrix, Server, User) should also be applicable. Default SET is changed by double pressing the appropriate SET key Dimmer is implied, but parameter would normally be specified after [+ ⟶ -] and before value. [CE] will backspace the command line one character at a time. If more than one state is involved, the state will backspace right up until the idle state. [Shift CE] will clear the command line to the beginning and put the system in an idle state. [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [[Full]/[Zero] (@100 and @00 are valid if % or text display format). Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [@] enter value. Two digits are required to complete value entry. [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [@] [@] will set values to Full. [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [@] single value, [ENTER]. E.g. [Fixture] [1⟶ 6] [@] [5] [ENTER] will set a value of 50%. [@] [7] [ENTER] would set a value of 70%. Pressing [ENTER] at the end of value input is optional and does not affect the sequence. In most cases, it will simply terminate the command line. [Fixture] # will jump the live display screen to the specified fixture if the fixture is not visible on the screen. (Fixture Jumping must be enabled in the Live Display, {Tools} (Wrench icon)Pop-up under the Behavior Tab [Fixture] # [+ ⟶ -] [@] [+] [value] or [@] [-] [value] will make a relative change to the stage value. E.g. {If the stage value is 50, @ + 10 will set the value to 60. @ - 30 would set the value to 20}. The rules for single digit plus Enter will also apply. [Fixture] # [⟶ ] #, Parameter, [@] {value] [⟶ ] [value] will fan the range. (if no parameter is specified, dimmer/intensity will be fanned) 0, and 100% are also valid as well as [Zero] and [Full]. [Fixture] # [⟶ ] # Parameter, [@] [value] [⟶ ][⟶ ] [value] will mirror fan the range. {1➡⟶ 100 would produce 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0} Fixture Dot = Restore last. Will have a toolbar equivalent. Fixture ⟶ = Reeelect Editor. Will have a toolbar equivalent. Fixtures and Parameters may be deselected using [RELEASE/DE SEL] Key. This leaves values in the editor but not under the control of the wheels. [GROUP] # selects all fixtures that are recorded into the group. *The typed fixture order is preserved in a recorded group. With groups, parameters may be fanned via syntax as above, but their recorded order will be considered. Control without having to press Shift, Reset, which clears the values in the Editor. {LIBRARY}, {LIBRARY}, will select and enter values from a library into the Editor. This is especially useful when using position libraries as groups with positions. 8.3.8 Setting Parameters using Main Encoder Wheels Vibe features the Smart Window to simplify programming. Programming may also be done traditionally using {Bank} keys and the 4 large push wheels: Using parameter wheels: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] Tap {Parameter Bank} on the Smart Screen. If the required parameter is not shown on the encoder wheel display, tap the {parameter Bank} to scroll through all available parameter pages. Turn the encoder wheel of the desired parameter to adjust values. Parameters other than dimmer do not use the @ key. Direct entry of absolute values: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] Tap {Parameter Bank} on Smart Screen. Tap the {Wheel Display} directly above the physical parameter wheel you wish to enter a value for. The wheel display turns red. Enter a value using the keypad. Direct entry of values using push wheels: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], Tap {Parameter Bank} on Smart Screen. Press physical wheel - Wheel display over the physical wheel turns red. Enter value via keypad. Select multiple parameters at the same time: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] Tap {Parameter Bank} on the Smart Screen. Toggle multiple parameters ON/OFF by tapping {parameter Keys}, pressing physical wheel, or toggling desired live display headers. Select all relevant fixture parameters in a parameter bank: Select all relevant fixture parameters in a parameter bank: Select Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], Hold [Vibe Key] and tap a {Parameter Bank Key}. Pressing and holding a {Parameter Bank} will pop-up three options: {HOME}, {ALL PARAMETERS}, {RELEASE ALL} {HOME} - Set the selected parmeters to “Home values”. {All} - Selects all relevant parameters in the parameter bank. {RELEASE ALL} - Releases the selected parameter from the Editor. 8.3.9 Setting Parameters using Interactive Encoder Wheels Vibe has 4 additional interactive push encoder wheels along the right hand side of the smart screen. The parameters assigned to the wheels are dependent on the bank and selected fixture type: E.g: Image assigns Focus and Zoom to the interactive wheels Color Mix assigns Color Wheel 1+2 to the interactive wheels Beam assigns Prism and Prism Rotate to the interactive wheels Shape assigns Focus and Zoom to the interactive wheels In future releases it will be possible for users to customize the defaults. In future releases it will be possible for users to customize the defaults. 8.3.10 Release and Home Sequences Release - Removes fixtures or fixture parameter values from the editor Release all active fixtures: Press {RELEASE] key Release fixtures: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] [RELEASE] Release a parameter: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] tap {Bank} select {Parameter}, [RELEASE] Release a Parameter Bank: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -] [VIBE] {Bank} [RELEASE] If a fixture is selected and then is made active (Red), the first press of release, releases the parameter and then the second press releases the whole fixture. All devices are assigned home values for parameters based on the manufacturer’s DMX chart. By default, these home values are used to tell the system where fixture parameters should be when they are not in use. Vibe has two options for home values. They can be set in the System Settings pop-up in the {Editing Properties} tab under the Default Stage Values header. System settings is accessed via the Vibe Menu or by tapping on the {✱} icon in the lower right corner of the main monitor controller display. {Use Home values} -Released parameters will be shown in grey and at their default home values. {Maintain Last Value} - Released parameters will be at the last value they were at before being released. Selected fixtures and/or parameters may be sent to their defaults using the [HOME] key. Home - Sets parameter values to home values as defined by the manufacturer or to custom values defined by the user Home Scene. Home works similar to Release: First press “homes” the current parameter. Second press “homes” all parameters for the selected fixtures. It is also possible to set a custom “Home Scene” that overrides the default Home: Set the values in the Editor similar to creating a Cue or a Scene. Press [SCENE] [HOME] [STORE] To Delete a Home Scene: Press [SCENE] [HOME] [DELETE] 8.4 Groups The order that fixtures are typed is stored with a group. Storing Groups to SKs: [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [STORE] tap desired {Group Softkey} - it does not matter if levels are set, they will be ignored. Labelling SK Groups: Directly after storing a group, while the focus is still on the group SK, start typing from the keyboard and a Text Entry pop-up will open. At any time, pressing the [TEXT] key followed by tapping the SK will open the Text Entry pop-up. Storing Groups via keypad syntax: [FIXTURE] [#] [+ ⟶ -] [#] [GROUP] [#] [STORE]. Pressing the [TEXT] key after any Group store will open the Text Entry popup. Modify Groups using Group Settings pop-up: Using keypad - press [GROUP] [#] [Settings] - the Group Settings pop-up will open. Range text labelling may be done via this method. Using SKs - Tap the source {GROUP} SK and then press [Settings] key Group Settings Pop-up A new Group may be created from existing Groups by selecting multiple Groups using Group SKs or via keypad. Press [STORE] then tap destination {Group} SK or Press [Group] [#] [STORE] to create the new Group. The new Group will not be linked to the original Groups. Groups may be used to release fixtures: With keypad - [GROUP] [#] [RELEASE] (Currently only works if ENTER is pressed after group selection) With SKs, {Group #}, [Release] Release a fixture from a Group Method 1: With softkeys: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], [STORE], tap {Group SK}, Group Efietel pop-up appears, select {Release} With keypad: Fixture # [+ ⟶ -], press [GROUP], #, [STORE], Group Efietel pop-up, appears, select {Release} Release a fixture from a Group Method 2: [GROUP [#] [EDIT] - [UPDATE] key flashes red ([EDIT] tap {GROUP SK} is also valid) [FIXTURE] [#] [RELEASE] Press [UPDATE] to complete the sequence To Delete a Group: [GROUP] # [DELETE] Tap {GROUP} [#] [DELETE] 8.5 Undo Undo button directly rolls back the last actions. Every parameter programmed in the editor can come back to its previous status by pressing the UNDO button. Pressing Undo button multiple times will restore step by step the last actions. Undo function can be used to recover the editor status after a Shift + Reset command, and to restore show elements such as groups, libraries, qlists, cues and scenes, that have been stored, deleted, or updated. Undo button works also with Home and High/Lowlight actions. 8.5.1 Undo History Settings ⟶ Undo opens the Undo/Redo list to review and restore the last actions. To Undo more operations at a time, access the Undo history with the sequence [Vibe + Settings, Undo] In the Undo popup’s left column are listed all the undoable actions, and in case an undo command has been done, the list on the right shows the redo able actions. Each action reports the date and time when it has been done. Select one or more actions, than press undo or redo to come back to the desired status. The popup does not close until the apply or restore buttons are pressed.

Group Submasters 9.1 What Are Qlists, Cues, Scenes, and Submasters? Qlists: Qlists are containers that hold cues. They might metaphorically be thought of as file folders. Each Qlist has its own unique Cue numbering system. Qlists currently may contain up to 8,000 cues. Qlists containing Cues must be assigned to Controllers before they can be output to the stage. Cues: Cues are stored containers of editor values. They might metaphorically be thought of as files or records. Cue may only exist within Qlists. Cues may be numbered from 0.001 ⟶ 999.999 Cues cannot be stored without a Qlist destination. Cues may be assigned: In Time Out Time Delay In Time Delay Out Time Text Label Scenes: Scenes are essentially a QList and a Cue combined. Scenes may only contain a single “Look” of editor values. Scenes assigned to Slider Controllers are given the default settings of: {GO + Jump Parameters} {Release At Bottom} Scenes may only be assigned In-TIme. Scenes may be given Text Labels Submasters: - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller’s value. All other parameter values are ignored. Groups may directly be assigned to controllers to create Group Submasters. Group Submasters reference the original Groups and update automatically if the Groups are modified. 9.2 Tracking Principals Vibe uses the Tracking/Move Fade philosophy common in most current lighting consoles. In tracking consoles, “Hard Values” (parameter values with stored information) track forward from cue to cue until new hard values are encountered. If we think of cues and values as a spreadsheet, basic tracking systems have two kinds of parameter value cells: “Hard Value” Cells “Tracking Cells” get their values by “seeing above” to the original hard values. They are basically transparent and only hard values are stored for a Cue. This is more efficient. Storing Cue information on a cell basis has other advantages: Each parameter cell can have its own individual time which overrides overall cue time. This allows, for example, Pan/Tilt to have a separate transition time or Color Wheels to snap to their values instead of using overall cue time. As Vibe’s default behavior for parameters it LTP (The last action takes precedent), a cell assigned its own time will continue to run its time until either the stored time runs out or it encounters a new hard value. Some traditional theatre consoles call “Hard Values” “Move Instructions” and cells that are in transition, “Move Fades”. Another advantage of tracking is that if you have values that are tracking through a number of cues, all you have to do is change the original hard values and that information will change down to the next hard value. You do not have to copy the change to each cue. An issue with tracking is that making a modification to values in one of the cues in the tracked range will change the values in all the cues following it. To solve this problem, Vibe offers two options: Qonly {Qonly} - Used in any case where cue modification, cue insertion, or cue deletion must affect “This Cue Only”. The look of the cue following any of the above operations will maintain the appearance it had before the operation. This is done by automatically copying the hard values that made up the original look (stage state) and pasting them into the cue following the modification. The downside is that there is no longer a tracking link from the original hard values even though the values match the original values. Skip Track {Skip} - Stores modified values as a special kind of cell that acts like a normal Tracking Cell until the Skip Cell is reached. The Skip Cell then behaves as if it has hard values and outputs its value to the stage. When the Qlist is advanced past a cue with the Skip Cells, they again behave as tracking cells, thus restoring the link to the original hard values. Storing a Cue modification using Skip, has the same apparent result as storing Qonly. The main difference is that with Qonly, the link to the original hard values is lost, and with Skip, the link is preserved. To make it easier for users to identify cues with Skip Cells, the parameter value with the Skip will be displayed in Magenta. Tracking examples: 9.3 Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers Cues and Scenes may be stored: Directly to the Master Controller using command line syntax. Directly to a specified Qlist and Cue using syntax. Directly to a controller. To store the first cue directly to a controller: Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [HERE] (to any of the buttons of a controller). The first available Qlist will be assigned to the controller and Cue 1 will be created. Alternately a Cue # may be specified in advance: [STORE] [CUE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). A Qlist # may also be specified in advance: [STORE] [QLIST] [3] [CUE] [1] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). To append additional cues to a controller: Set parameter values in the Editor then press the [STORE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of a controller that already has cues stored on it). A cue will be appended to the first available whole number of the Qlist To Store a Scene to a controller: Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [SCENE] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). The first available Scene # will be assigned to the controller. No Qlist will be assigned. Alternately a Scene # may be specified in advance. [STORE] [SCENE] [3] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller). To convert a Scene to a Qlist: Press [STORE] [HERE] to an existing Scene. The Store to Controller pop-up will appear. Tap {Create a new Qlist} the Scene will be assigned the first available Qlist with the Scene’s look being converted to Cue 1. 9.4 Master Controller In Vibe, at least one controller must be assigned as the [SELECT] controller. This controller will now be linked to the Master Controller. The Master Controller has 4 large buttons associated with it: [GO] - Initiates a forward timed fade between cues in the selected Qlist. [BACK] - Backs up one cue at a time using system timing properties’ Back Time. [HOLD] - Pauses the progress of a fade [GOTO] - Advances to the specified cue in system timing properties’ GOTO Time. Associated with but not limited to the controller assigned as the [SELECT] Controller are the following 3 buttons: [Load] - Preloads a controller with a specified cue # but does not advance to the cue. Pressing [GO] will advance to the preloaded cue using cue time. [Release] - Releases the destination controller from affecting the stage (Turns it off). [Free] - Unloads the controller. [Load] [Release] and [Free] do not work with the big Master Controller buttons, only with any button on the controller that is associated with it as the [SELECT] controller. By default cues that do not have a Qlist or Controller specified in their destination will be stored to the controller selected as the Master Controller. 9.5 Storing Cues to the Master Controller A Qlist must be assigned to the [SELECT] controller before cues can be stored using theatre style keypad syntax A Qlist does not have to contain cues to be assigned to a controller To assign a Qlist to a controller and make it the Master Controller: Press [QLIST] [#] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller) - The Qlist will be assigned to the controller. Press [SELECT] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller) - The destination controller will now be the Master Controller and the [Second Button] of the “Selected” controller will turn dark blue to indicate that it is now assigned to the Master Controller. The top header of the Controller Display on the main monitor above the controller will also turn dark blue. To Store a cue to the Master Controller: Set Parameter levels in the Editor the press [CUE] [#] [STORE]. The cue will be added to the Master Controller’s assigned Qlist. Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001 → 999.999 Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax or the Direct Store method. Pressing [STORE] [STORE] or [STORE] [ENTER] will store editor values to the next whole number cue at the end of a Qlist. (Next spacing can be customized in system settings). Vibe uses the “Clear Editor After Store” behavior common in most theatre consoles. The Controller will by default advance to the stored cue and clear the Editor. This behavior may be disabled in System Settings. 9.6 Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller The destination Qlist must be assigned to a controller in advance or after storing the first Cue, the destination Qlist will bump the current cue on the Master Controller out and replace it.. To store a Cue to a Qlist that is already assigned to a Controller: (Usually not the Master Controller) Press [Qlist] [#] [HERE] to any button of the destination controller. The Qlist will be assigned to the controller Set parameter levels in the Editor Press [Qlist] [#] [CUE] [#] [STORE] Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001 → 999.999 Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax specifying the Qlist # in advance or 9.3. Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers​ 9.7 Cue Store Options In the process of storing a cue, a number of filters and settings are available. To open the Store Options pop-up, two methods are available: Store cues using keypad syntax: Set values in the Editor. [CUE] [#] [OPTIONS] Cue Store Options pop-up opens. Make selections and press [STORE]. Store directly to a Qlist on a Controller: Set Values in the Editor. Press [STORE] [OPTIONS] Cue Options pop-up opens. Make selections and press [HERE] to any button on the destination controller. Cue Store Options Pop-up Options are: Editor as Source: {Red + Grey} Editor Values in 100% 90% will be stored. {Store Stage} All fixtures outputting ANY DMX from the console will be stored. This includes tracked values, home values and dimmer values at zero. {Red Only} Only Editor values in Red will be stored. This can be a useful way to filter parameters. {All Param For Selected} All parameters from the fixture selection will be turned red and stored in the cue. {All Param If Active} All parameters of all fixtures in the editor will be stored if the dimmer parameter is greater than zero (WYSIWYG). Additional: {DMX In} Takes a snapshot of incoming DMX and attaches it to the cue. {Force Black} When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first “forced” to Black Out, parameters they move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. Filtering: {Show Filters} Opens user prebuilt filters in the pop-up. Source behavior when stored: {Track} Normal system behavior {Skip Cue} - Tags a cue as a skip cue in the case of inserting a new cue. In the case of updating a cue by storing to an existing cue, only the values being updated will be made into Skip cells. . {Qonly} Inserted cues will not affect the look of cues following them Look Ahead: (sometimes referred to as Mark Cue) See: 14.3. Force Black Unlike having to Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in Cue Store Options as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just the tagged cue. Force Black - See: 14.1. Look Ahead (Move in Dark) Tagged a cue as {Force Black} in Cue Store Options, is the same as setting the cue as {Force Black} in {Cue settings}. 9.8 Assigning Text Labels Assign a Text Label to a Qlist: Method 1 - [QLIST] [#] [TEXT] opens the Text Entry pop-up. Method 2 - [QLIST [#] [SETTINGS] opens the Qlist Properties tab or Qlist popup. Method 3 - Press the Qlist header above a loaded Controller, The Qlist Properties pop-up opens - Enter Qlist Text in the white box. To assign a Text Label to a Cue: Method 1 - [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#][TEXT] opens Text Entry pop-up. Method 2 - If assigned to the Master Controller, [CUE] [#] [TEXT] Opens Text Entry pop-up. Method 3 - [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] opens {Cue Properties} tab of Cue Settings pop-up. Enter Qlist text in the Text Box. Method 4 - [TEXT] [HERE] press any button on the destination controller. Method 5 - Press {Cue label} area of the display above the Controller - The Cue Properties pop-up opens. Select the desired cue. Enter cue text in the text box. Optionally notes may also be entered for the selected cue. 9.9 Modifying Cues and Scenes Modify a Cue or Scene using [UPDATE]: Make a change to parameter values already outputting to the stage from an active cue or scene. Press the [UPDATE] and the Update pop-up will open. Two columns will appear. The left column shows Cues available for updating and the right column shows Libraries available for updating. If affected values are not referencing a library, the Cue column will indicate the source cue that the modifications will be updated to. If the Editor parameter values are new to all active cues, destination cue. Will be dependent on the New Values setting: If {All Selected Objects} is selected, a list of all possible active cues will appear in the Cue column. If {Master PB Only} (controller) is selected, new values will be only be updated to the Qlist assigned as Master Controller. If {Don’t Store} is selected, no new parameter values will be updated. Selected cues may be freely deselected in the Update pop-up. Set Tracking Options as required. Set Source Filters as required. Press or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and complete the Update. UPDATE Source Filters: {Master Controller} - Updates will only be made to the active cue on the controller assigned to the Master Controller. {Last Activated Controller} - Updates will be made to the last controller that asserter priority. {Grab All} - All Active Controllers will be shown in a list and the user must select the destination of the updates. UPDATE Tracking Options: {Default (Track)} - Changes will track forward to the next cue if it does not have a hard value. {Cue Only} - Changes will be made to “This Cue Only” preserving the look of the next cue (Hard values will be added to next cue). {Skip Cue} - Changes will be made to the current cue but the changes will be “skipped over” preserving the link to the original hard values. {Back Track} - Updates the changes to the original hard value that made the stage look. Update directly to a Controller: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Press [UPDATE] - The Update pop-up will open. Make option changes if needed. Press [HERE] to any button on a destination Controller - the Editor values will be updated into the active cue on the destination Controller. Update values to a cue or range of cues using keypad syntax: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Type [Qlist] [#] (if destination cue/cues are not on the Master Controller) [CUE] [+ ⟶ -] [CUE] [#] [UPDATE] - Modifications will now be updated to the destination cue selection. Cues may alternately be modified using the universal syntax below: Modify cues using EDIT: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [EDIT] - Cue values will be placed in the Editor and the [UPDATE] key will flash red. Modify the parameters in the Editor as required. Press [UPDATE] to complete the edit and restore control to the source controller. This method may be used in [BLIND] and unlike live, fixtures may be released from the source cue. Effects may also be edited Modifying cues using {Overwrite}, {Update}, or {Release} keys - (Traditional method common to most consoles) Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage. Press [QLIST] (in not not on the Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [STORE]. If the cue exits, the Cue Exists pop-up will appear with options for {Cancel, Update, Overwrite, Release}. Tap {Overwrite} to replace all fixtures with those in the Editor. Tap {Update} to merge the Editor into the selected cue. Tap {Release} to remove the selected fixtures from the cue. Cue Exists pop-up Cue Settings pop-up Cue Settings for Text Label, Cue Time, Cue Linking and Looping, Cue Re-numbering and Cue Tracking options may be changed at any time after they are created using the Cue Settings pop-up: Press [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - The Cue Settings pop-up will appear. Alternately tapping the {Cue # } area of the source Controllers’ display, will open the Cue Settings pop-Up. Controller Display (Sliders, A/B, Master Controller (MPB), System Settings) To Delete a Cue: [Qlist] [#] (Optional if [SELECT] controller) [CUE [#] [DELETE] 9.10 Creating New Cues from Existing Cue Data To Copy a Cue to a new Cue: [CUE] [#] [COPY] The Copy Cue Pop-up will open Three Options are available: {Actual Cue} - Copies cue properties as well as stored parameter values {State} - Copies all of the hard values and tracked values that make up the source cue’s “End State” (Stage look) {Values Only} - Copies only the hard values that are stored in the source cue [CUE] [#] [PASTE] - The Cue Only Pop-up will open Three Options are available:: {Paste} {Cue Only} {Paste} {Skip} {OK} {Cancel} Choose an option and the operation will be completed To create a new cue using values from an existing cue, use one of the following two menu commands: [CUE] [#] {LOAD} - Loads the cue’s actual hard values into the Editor. Tracked values are ignored. Or [CUE] [#] {LOAD STATE} - Loads the cue’s hard values and current tracked values (Stage State) into the Editor. Continue modifications and store as a new cue. 9.11 Cue Time Properties Cue Time Properties: 9.11.1. Assigning Cue Time 9.11.2. Wait and Follow Times 9.11.1 Assigning Cue Time {(#assigning-cue-time-9.11.1.} Cues may be assigned the following time properties: Time Time In Time Out Delay In Delay Out Follow Time Wait Time Time Pop-up Assign a simple in/out time to the current cue: Press [CUE] [#] Press [TIME], the Time pop-up will appear Enter a value with the keypad. The default unit of time will be seconds. Press [ENTER] or to exit the pop-up and assign the cue time. Assign a separate {Time In} {Time Out}, and/or {Delay In} {Delay Out} times to the current cue: Press [CUE] [#] Press [TIME], the Time pop-up will appear. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Time In}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Time Out}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay In}. Press [TIME] again and the display will advance to {Delay Out}. Alternately times can be randomly entering by tapping the desired time field and making a keypad entry or turning the virtual wheel. When typing any time value, the time indicator of the virtual wheel will turn green for approximately 4 seconds. While it is green time values may be entered in the format of: Hour.Minute.Second.Millisecond If the {Enable} key is pressed, the user may manually toggle between time units using the {Units} key to the left of it. Out times only apply to dimmer parameters. 9.11.2 Wait and Follow Times There are two ways to make a cue automatically follow another: Wait Time - Starts counting down from the [GO] press before the next cue is executed. Follow Time - Advances to the next cue upon completion of the cue time and all of its individual parameter times. Set a Wait Time: Select the cue you want the Wait to be executed from. Press [TIME] - the Time Pop-up will appear. Tap {Wait} and either type in the Wait Time or use the virtual time wheel to set the Wait Time. To clear a Wait Time, turn the physical Wait Wheel until its display and the {Wait} display say N/A , Press [ENTER] Set a Follow Time: Select the cue you want the Follow from. Press [TIME] - the Time pop-up will appear. Tap {Follow} and either type in the Follow Time or use the virtual time wheel to set the Follow Time. To clear a Follow, turn the physical Follow Wheel until its display and the {Follow} display say N/A Press [ENTER} 9.12 Additional Cue Properties Additional Cue Properties: ​9.12.1. Link​ ​9.12.2. Loop​ ​9.12.3. Tracking Options. 9.12.1 Link Cues may be linked out of sequence using any of the following three methods: Using keypad and Toolbar: Source [CUE] [#] {LINK} on the Editor Toolbar - The Link pop-up will appear. Type link destination [#] (Do not press [CUE]). Press Enter or to complete the operation. Using Cue Setting pop-Up: Source [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - Cue Settings pop-up will open. Tap {Link} - The Link pop-up will appear. Type, scroll or drag to the desired destination cue. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Press Enter or again to close the Settings pop-up. Direct using the cue sheet: Tap in the Link field of the source cue in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet The Link pop-up will appear. Type, scroll or drag to the desired destination cue. Press Enter or again to close the Settings pop-up. To remove a Link: Select the source cue and open the Link pop-up by any of the above methods. If the proper source cue has been selected, the {Unlink} key will appear. Tap {Unlink} key to remove the Link. Alternate method: Select the source [CUE] [#] and tap {Link} on the Editor Toolbar, the Link pop-up will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the link. If the source cue is forgotten, check the Link # field in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet. In cue sheet, cues that are disabled because of a Link are grayed out. 9.12.2 Loop In many consoles, the only way to create a loop is to create a link from the end of a range of cues back to the beginning. Follow time must then be assigned to all of the cues. In Vibe this is also possible but a shorter more efficient method is also provided. LOOP is a function similar to LINK. It is assigned in the Loop pop-up or via the Cue Settings pop-up. Loop Pop-up To assign a Loop: Using keypad and Editor Toolbar: Start [CUE] [#] tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop pop-up will appear. Type end [#] or use {To Cue No} field list to select the end cue. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Using Cue Setting Pop-Up: Start [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS] - Cue Settings pop-up will open. Tap {Loop} - Loop pop-up will appear. Type end Cue [3] or scroll the value picker to the desired end cue [#]. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Press Enter or again to close the Settings pop-up. Direct via the cue sheet: Tap in the Loop # field of the start cue in the Live Master Controller Cue Sheet - The Loop pop-up will appear. Type, scroll or drag to the desired end cue. Press Enter or to complete the operation. To assign a Loop Count - A Loop Count may be assigned using any of the above methods to open the Loop pop-up. Make sure {Auto Loop} is selected. Under the {# Of Time To Loop} field, Type loop count number, or scroll the value picker to the desired loop count number. Press Enter or to complete the operation. To enable {Auto Follow} - Auto Follow loops advance to the cue following the loop, after completion of the loop count. Toggle {Auto Follow} - On/Off as required. To set a Loop as Manual Loop (Does not advance automatically) Toggle {Auto Loop} - Off To remove a Loop: (Qlist must be released first) Select the start cue and open the Loop pop-up by any of the above methods. If the proper start cue has been selected, the {Unloop} key will appear. Tap the {Unloop} key to remove the Link. Press Enter or to complete the operation. Alternate method: (Qlist must be released first) Select the start {CUE] [#] and tap {LOOP} on the Editor Toolbar - The Loop pop-up will appear. Press [RELEASE] to remove the loop. In live playback view, cues that are set as Loop Cues have an orange color. 9.12.3 Tracking Options Individual cues may be tagged with one of four Tracking Options: Cue Only - Removes tracked values from asserting to the stage and sets them at home values (Not to be confused with Cue Only when used with {UPDATE} which works a cell basis). Skip Cue - All cells in the cue will behave like Skip Cells. Values will still “skip around” a Skip Cue, even if the values in the Skip Cue are modified. Block Cue - All cue parameter values whether tracked or hard will be made to act like hard values. Any new values added to cues above the Blocked cue will not track past a cue tagged a Block. Track - The systems default behavior. There are two additional properties a cue can be tagged with: Force Black - When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first “forced” to Black Out, parameters then move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. Look Ahead cue - When Look Ahead is disabled for a Qlist, Individual cues with dark values may be tagged to perform Look Ahead pre-positioning. In live playback view, cues that are set as Block Cues have a blue color. In live playback view, cues that are set as Skip Cues have a magenta color. 9.13 Parameter Time Parameter Time: 9.13.1. Assign Parameter Time During Cue Creation 9.13.2. Adding or Modifying Parameter Time after Cue Creation 9.13.3. Fanning Parameter Time Time 9.13.1 Assign Parameter Time During Cue Creation Set fixture parameter values in the Editor. Select the fixtures requiring Parameter Time.

The following is covered in this chapter: 11.1. What are Libraries 11.2. Store and Modify Bank Libraries 11.3. Object Libraries 11.4. Auto Generate 11.1 What are Libraries Vibe has two types of Libraries, Bank Libraries and Object Libraries: Bank Libraries - Store commonly used parameter values for Intensity, Position, Color, Beam, Image, Shapers, and Video content. They correspond to the parameter banks. Libraries are essentially filtered cues that are referenced by recorded objects such as Scenes and Cues. There are also two special bank libraries, Custom, and Effects. Custom libraries are unfiltered and record whatever parameters are in the Editor. The system FILTERS key function or user defined Filter object libraries may be used to limit which parameters are stored in Custom libraries. Effect libraries store effects parameters from the Editor so that they do not have to be manually rebuilt every time they are required. Object Libraries - Pools of system object types. Common Object Libraries are: Group Qlist Scenes– Single non-Qliet “Looks”(Submasters on some consoles) Snaps – Snapshot controller states. Sometimes referred to as Snap Shots Filters – Pool of user defined flters Macro Scenes are like Submasters or Group Masters on other consoles. They may be set as additive or subtractive. 11.2 Store and Modify Bank Libraries 11.2. Store and Modify Bank Libraries Compulite Libraries are similar to Presets or Palettes on other consoles. Automatic Parameter Grouping: Vibe uses tee concept of “Auto Parameter Grouping” parameters when storing libraries. All parameters in Position, Color, and Shaper parameter banks will always be recorded into a library to guarantee that what was viewed on the stage is the same as what is recorded in the library. Filters may be applied to modify what is stored in a Library. Libraries can be assigned one of six behaviors: Fixture Specific – Values only applied only to specific stored fixtures. Parameter Specific – Values will be applied to all matching parameter types. Pattern –Values will be applied to all matching parameter types and will keep the pattern of the values. Device + Fixture – the first fixture will be used as a reference for all other similar fixture types. If values are changed for specific fixtures they will be stored in the library as if they were fixture specific. If a fixture other than the first fixture is released from the library, its values will again be referenced from the first fixture. If the first fixture is released, the next fixture will become the reference. Device and Parameter – Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device type and the same parameter type. Device and pattern – Values will be applied to fixtures of the same device type and keep the pattern of values. Library Bank SKs have default filters and behaviors based on the way they are commonly used. Store directly to a Bank SK Library: [Fixture] [#] [+ ⟶ -] Select parameter {Bank} on Smart Screen. Use keypad, Smart Screen pickers, and/or adjust parameter wheels, to set values. Press [STORE] - The Library {Store Options} tab will appear on top right corner of SKs. Use the Library {Store Options} pop-up at the bottom on the Smart Screen to make option changes. Tap destination Library SK. If no option changes are required just directly tap the appropriate Library SK without tapping the Library {Store Options}. Store a Library using keypad syntax: Press [Fixture] [#] [+ ⟶ -] - Select parameter {Bank } on Smart Screen. Use Smart Screen pickers, and/or adjust parameter wheels, or type value to set values. Press [LIBRARY] - Library {Store Options} pop-up will open at the bottom of the Smart Screen and {Banks} will appear on the Editor Toolbar. Tap a parameter {Bank} key on the Editor Toolbar. Enter the destination library number via the keypad. Make {Library Store Options} changes as required. Press [STORE] to complete the sequence. A shortcut for Bank selection is to specify a number directly after pressing [LIBRARY] key: 1 = Intensity bank 2 = Position bank 3 = Color bank 4 = Beam bank 5 = Image 6 = Shape 7 = Custom 8 = Effect After typing the first number, the bank name will appear on the command line. The next number typed will be the library number. Modify a Library using [UPDATE]: Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage from a library referenced in an active cue or scene. Press the [UPDATE] - The Update pop-up will open. Two columns will appear. The left column shows Cues available for updating and the right column shows Libraries available for updating. The source library or libraries should be selected. Selected libraries may be freely deselected in the Update pop-up.

The user can configure the numbering and the number of libraries to be created, by selecting the generate options in the popup menu. It is possible to merge or to overwrite the auto generated libraries with the already existing ones. Libraries can be named using system names or library numbers, and customized for example using the device’s name. Libraries can be numbered starting from a desired number or appended for the first available position. Libraries of different fixture types can be spaced with the desired interleave. Auto generated libraries are created when pressing the GENERATE button on the down right corner. It is possible to check the preferred options on each bank page and then generate them in a single click, as well as to generate them step by step for each device or for each bank. "],["effects.html", "Chapter 12 Effects 12.1 Effect Basics 12.2 Smart Screen Effects Editor 12.3 Advanced Effects Editor 12.4 Library Effects", " Chapter 12 Effects This chapter discusses Vibe’s two effect editors. The following is covered in this chapter: 12.1. Effect Basics 12.2. Smart Screen Effects Editor 12.3. Advanced Effects Editor 12.4. Library Effects 12.1 Effect Basics All Screen captures below are from the Advanced Effects Editor. Vibe Effects are made up of Effect Events running along horizontal Effect Tracks. Each Event Track must have: At least one parameter assigned in the far left column. Additional parameters may be added but they will respond simultaneously to the Effect. One Effect Event. Additional Effect Events may be added to the track each with its own time base or Effects may be merged and share a time base. Multi-track effects: Effects requiring more than one parameter may be stacked on separate Effects Tracks. Examples of Multi-track effects would be: CMY and RGB color effects Pan/Tilt Circles Blade effects All Effect Events are built from the following components: Functions Primitives Patterns Functions: Are the basic building blocks of effects. They may be assigned to Primitives and Patterns. Vibe uses functions as the raw building blocks for three features of the console: Primitives - Main element of Effects Profiles - Used for cue transitions Curves - Used for dimmer behavior Vibe ships with a number of “read only” Functions. They may not be edited. Users may create their own functions in the Advanced Effect’s Function Editor. Primitives: When Functions are linked to parameters on an Effect Track, the are called Primitives. Primitives modulate parameter values based on their assigned Functions. Primitives may be modified by a number of Primitive settings. Primitive Settings: Time - The duration of time it takes each fixture to complete one cycle across the Primitive. Size - The amplitude of the Primitive’s function. Base - The Y axis of start of the Primitive’s function when each fixture crosses it. In Base - Adjusts the direction from the parameters start point (Base) it is linked to the Swing {Up} [Center} {Down} keys. E.g. If the Base value of tilt is 50% (0°) and the In Base is Center (-50%), tilt would split center with a sine wave primitive assigned to it. Up (0%) would send the tilt from strait down to full out into the audience. Down (-100%) would send the tilt from strait down to full up upstage. Pattern: Sets the behavior of fixture selection as it transitions across the Primitive. Pattern Settings: Spread (Offset) - Sets the percentage of offset between each fixture in a selection. 100% would evenly divide up the selection’s transition across the Primitive. A Spread of 0% would have all fixtures transitioning across the Primitive in unison. UP - Based on the UP group #, Each UP grouping will complete a full cycle across the primitive before the next UP group can start. e.g. A selection of 8 fixtures assigned to a primitive with a sine wave function and a spread of 100%, UP is set to 1, Fixture 1 will have to complete its full cycle across the Primitive before fixture 2 will begin. If the UP # is set to 2 fixture 1 and 2 will have split the cycle before the next two fixtures start. Effects: The combination of Parameters, Primitives, and Patterns. Effects Settings: Settings that affect both Primitives and Patterns (Effect Event) are called Effect settings. Effect setting are integrated into the Smart Screen Editor and are available by tapping the empty space beside the Effect Event in the Advanced Editor. Offset All - Moves the start time of the Effect Event along the X axis of the Effect Track. Params Spread - Is a toggle button that enables the proportional offsetting of the start times of multiple Effect Tracks at the same time. {Params Spread} is a quick way to make CMY or RGB effects where colors need to spread apart so as not to mix to black or white. Effects Libraries: Once effects have been created then may be directly stored in cues and scenes or saved in Effects Libraries for future use. Effect Libraries are stored similar to normal Libraries Store and Modify Bank Libraries. Effects libraries have one additional option to allow users to include the base values. This is useful when effects must start from an absolute value. 12.2 Smart Screen Effects Editor The Smart Screen Effects Editor allows users to quickly build effects within the normal work flow of the console while still having access to the main live displays. Effect Tracks are created for every selected parameter but they are hidden to remove screen clutter. Some advance operations are removed to speed up programming of simple effects. Two pages are available in the Smart Screen Editor: Attributes - Used for building Effect Events. Grouping - Used for setting fixture Blocks Of (Fixture Grouping in Vector) and Sub Blocks Of (Blocks on some console). Smart Screen Attribute page 12.2.1 Building Effects Using the Small Screen Editor To build an Effect in the Smart Screen Effects Editor: Select the the fixtures to be used in the Effect. Select the parameter/parameters to be in the Effect 8.3.2. What are Parameters Press [EFFECT] - The Smart Screen Effect Editor will open in the {Attributes} display with a blank Effect Event. Tap the Pre Built tab and make a selection. Or Tap the Favorite Primitive tab and select a Primitive - the Function shown on the Primitive will be loaded with a default linear Pattern. The Pattern may be changed by by tapping any of the following: / Fixtures move in a positive direction across the selection.  Fixture move in a negative direction across the selection. / Fixture mirror in a positive direction. / Fixture mirror in a negative direction. Set the Offset {Pattern Spread} - Default is 100%. 100% = Selection is divided 100% transitioning across the Primitive. 0% = all fixtures transition in unison. Set Swing (In Base) as needed 12.1. Effects Basics Adjust Size and Base to set the Low and High ranges of the values Set the Rate - x.xx Rate is a multiplier of the time value. Default Effect Time is 4 seconds to complete the cycle Similar results to inverting the pattern functions may be achieved by reversing the selection direction with the {⟵ Negative}, {Positive ⟶ } keys Smart Screen Grouping: For Grouping to be noticeable there must be an Pattern Offset Spread above 0%. Tap the {Grouping} key - The Grouping page will open. If the Offset Pattern Spread is not above 0%, tap the {Wave On} key. The Spread will be changes to 100%. Set the {Blocks Of} [#] - This interleaves the Pattern into Groupings. The Default for Blocks and Sub Block is 1/0 - No Groupings. When {Blocks Of} is set to 1 or above, the Sub Blocks will move to 1 and Interleave Groups will be possible. e.g. 2/1 would interleave a selection into Odds/Evens. e.g. 3/1 would interleave a selection of 12 fixtures into [1+4+7+10] - [2+5+8+11] - [3+6+9+12] Set the {Sub Blocks Of} - Combines fixture in a selection, to act like single fixtures. e.g. 12/2 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12] As a shortcut, Setting {Sub Block Of} back to 0 allows {Blocks Of} to combine fixtures instead of interleaving - 2/0 would combine [1+2] - [3+4] - [5+6] - [7+8] - [9+10] - [11+12] The Advanced Effects Editor may be opened at any time by pressing [Vibe] Effects. All Effects running in the Smart Screen Effects Editor will be synchronized with the Advanced Editor After programming an Effect, Close the editor using the in the upper right corner. 12.3 Advanced Effects Editor Both Effect Editors write to the same Effect Engine. Either or both may be used to create effects. Whichever is opened at the time will be synchronized to the Effects Engine, but only one Effect Editor may open at a time. Selecting multiple columns and rows: It is possible to make simultaneous changes to Primitive, Pattern, and Effect settings by toggling them on/off. Advanced Effect Editor The Advanced Effects Editor differs from the Smart Screen Effects Editor in the following ways: Parameter selection is made in the Effects Editor not before entering it. Effect Tracks are shown. Multiple Parameters may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Multiple Effects Events may be assigned to the same Effect Track. Effect sharing the same Effect Track can uses separate patterns or share patterns. Pattern Size, Rate, and Base may be spread to create randomized looking effects. Repeat - The number of times each Effect Event repeats before moving on the the next Effects Event, when they are sharing an Effects Track. Building Effects in the Advanced Editor differs from the Smart Screen Editor in that a only a fixture selection is needed before entering the editor. Parameters are selected using the {Filters} and {Choose Parameter} . This takes a bit longer but is more flexible. 12.3.1 Build a basic Effect in the Advanced Effects Editor Build a basic Effect in the Advanced Effects Editor: Select the fixtures to be used in the Effect.

Playback Master 13.13. Move Controllers 13.1 Controller Priority Logic Controller Priority: Vibe keeps an LTP priority list of which controllers own parameters and the order in which they were asserted. Every time a controller is turned on, its parameters are asserted and the controller moves to the top of the list. Parameters that are still on active controllers but are currently overridden are said to be “robbed”. When the controller that owns the parameter is released from the stage, the last active controller to own the robbed parameter is now moved back to the top of the list and reasserted the parameter to the stage. This feature is very useful for “On the Fly” programming where a main Qlist may be temporarily overridden by Qkeys or Controllers and quickly restored when they are released. The Editor is always the highest propriety and will override any values from controllers until they are released or The Editor is reset. Priority Groups: Controllers assigned the same Priority Group number will be LTP amongst themselves. Controllers assigned higher Propriety Group numbers cannot be overridden (“robbed”) by controllers with lower numbers. Assigning Controllers to priority Groups: 1. Tap the top area of a controller display, the Settings pop-up will open. 2. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. OR Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button, the Settings pop-up will open. Select the {Controller Settings} Tab. Rotate the virtual wheel to the desired Priority Group number or tap the center of the wheel until it turns red and type a Priority Group number from 0 - 999. 13.2 Controller Overview Controllers are used to playback or execute a number of objects: Cues Scenes Group Submasters Libraries Macros Snaps Vibe has five controller types: Three button Motorized Slider Controllers Single button Qkey Controllers (or pressable knob) Single Auxiliary Qkey Controllers Non-Motorized Global Slider Controllers A/B “theatre style” A/B dipless crossfader pair QKeys and AuxKeys can also have a virtual button, a virtual fader, or a virtual set of fader and button. Vibe software makes no distinction between physical and virtual controllers. This allows the system hardware to be scaled. Below is a list of total quantities of physical and virtual controllers that are supported. Controller quantities and numbering: Physical and Virtual 30 pages of 100 Motorized Sliders - Numbered 1.1 ⟶ 30.100 30 pages of 100 Qkeys - Numbered 1.101 ⟶ 30.200 30 pages of 100 Auxiliary Qkeys - Numbered 1.201 ⟶ 30.300 100 Non-motorized Global Sliders - Numbered 301 ⟶ 400 1 Non-motorized A/B dipless crossfader - Numbered 401 Controllers are numbered from right to left to facilitate continuous numbering with physical and virtual controller wings. Compound Controllers: Controllers may be extended in width and height to make larger compound controllers. This is useful in creating additional crossfader pairs or adding controls for rate and effects. There is no limit as to how wide a controller may be, but for practical purposes, a limit of 6 wide is suggested. If Playback slider controllers and Qkey buttons are linked to the same object, it could be comfortable to synchronize the paging of Sliders and Qkeys. This is possible to do by pressing SHIFT button together with the Up/Down paging buttonsof either Playbacks or Qkeys. A/B Cross Faders: An A/B Cross Fader Pair is provided for manual “Theater Style” playback of cues. By default, the fader on the left will control dimmer parameters fading in. By default, the fader on the right will control all other values including the dimmer that is fading out. Parameter values that match will not dip even if the A and B are at different levels. 13.3 Master Controller Master Controller: Any single Controller may be linked to the Master Controller by Pressing [SELECT] [HERE] to any of the buttons of the controller. [GO] - Initiates a forward transition from one cue to another using Cue Time. [BACK] - Initiates a transition to the previous cue using system Default Back Time. [HOLD] - Pauses a cue in transition. Pressing [HOLD] again resumes the transition. Pressing [GO] will resume the transition as well. Pressing [BACK] will fade to the previous cue. The A/B is only linked to the Master Controller if the [SELECT] is assigned to A/B.. 13.4 GOTO and LOAD GOTO and LOAD are used to crossfade to cues out of sequence. By default, GOTO immediately transitions to the specified cue in the system GOTO Time. LOAD preloads controllers. The next [GO] will transition to the preloaded cue in Cue Time. GOTO Commands: GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system GOTO Time: [CUE] [#] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using a specified Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] - Enter time value [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using system Cue Time: [CUE] [#] [TIME] [GOTO] GOTO a cue on the Master Controller using Goto Cue pop-up: Press [GOTO] - Goto Cue pop-up will open. Select {Qlist} if not the current Qlist on the Master Controller. Select the {Cue}. Select behavior. {Default GOTO time} - Uses system default GOTO Time. {Cue Time} - Uses Cue’s recorded time. {Custom} - Set GOTO time using the Custom Time wheel or tap centre of the wheel until it turns red and set time value from the keypad. {Release Master PB on Top} - Releases the Master Controller. Press the or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and execute the GOTO. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one.. GOTO a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [GO] (Controller must have a GO button assigned). GOTO Cue Zero - Cue Zero is essential {Release Master PB to Top}. [CUE] [0] [GOTO] It is also possible to go out of sequence directly to a Cue on the Master Controller (in cue time): [CUE] [#] [GO] Load Commands: Load a cue on the Master Controller - Method 1. [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - To Controller assigned as [SELECT] Press [GO] - On Controller assigned as [SELECT] Load a cue on the Master Controller - Method 2. [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [LOAD] Press [GO] - Using Master Controller GO or GO of controller assigned as [SELECT] LOAD a cue NOT on the Master Controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [LOAD] [HERE] - Qlist and Cue will be preloaded. Press [GO] - Controller will execute loaded cue. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Controller is specified, that Qlist will replace the current one with the specified cue pending. 13.5 Configuring Controllers Controller buttons and sliders may be customized to allow maximum flexibility. When Qlists and Scenes are initially assigned to Controllers, the buttons are configured as per the System Settings defaults for Controller and Controller Action. Defaults are accessed by tapping the System Status area at the far right side of the controller display. ​ ​ Assigning Buttons and Slider Behavior: Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any button of the controller that has an object assigned to it - The Slider Definitions pop-up will appear with the {Controller Definitions} tab selected. Alternatively, tap any of the controller {function labels} on the controller display on the monitor above the Scene Slider. If a Qlist other than the one that is currently on the Master Controller is selected, that Qlist will replace the current one. Tap one of the three assignable {Buttons} or the {Slider} button in the centre - A context sensitive drop down menu based on the object assigned and the specific button selected will appear. Choose a Control behavior from the menu. Assignable Button Behavior: Assignable Slider Behavior: Default settings for controllers assigned Qlists, Scenes, and Submasters may be set in the Defaults section of the System Settings Pop-up. See 6.5.1. Controller Settings. 13.6 Controller Color Codes Controller Live Display color coding If [SELECT] Master Controller: If from a non-[Select] Controller: Controller Display and Backlit Controller Key’s color coding: 13.7 Working With controllers Controller types: - Detailed Control Keys: Provide “On the Fly” access to button functions not directly assigned to controllers. Apply a Controller Key: Press a {Control Key} Press any destination [Controller Button] to apply the Control Key’s function In most cases, double press of the Control Keys locks them on until pressed again. Control Key Functions: FLASH - Momentarily turns on a Controller.  Most useful when locked on with double press. SOLO - Turns off intensity parameters on all controllers excluding the destination controller. GO/RELEASE - First press initiates a GO, second press initiates a RELEASE.  Most useful when locked on with double press. ON - Instantly turns on a controller. OFF - Instantly turns off a controller. Latch - Currently unimplemented. GO - Initiates a GO command. ASSERT - Takes back control of parameters that have been “robbed” by other controllers. HOLD/BACK - If a controller is running, pause the controller. If a controller is static, initiate a BACK command. &lt;&lt;&lt; (Step Back) - Steps backwards through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [BACK] will also step backwards through the list. &gt;&gt;&gt; (Step Forward) - Steps forward through a Qlist ignoring time  [VIBE] + [GO] will also step forward through the list. &lt;&lt;&lt;–&gt;&gt;&gt; - Reverses sequence direction (mainly used with loops and chasers). Assign a Qlist to a Controller: [QLIST] [#] [HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the start point of the range. Blank Qlists may be assigned to any controller. Assign a range of Qlist: [QLIST] [#] → [QLIST] [#] [HERE] to any button of the controller that will be the start point of the range. Assign a Cue to a controller: [QLIST] [#] [CUE] [#] [HERE] Press any of the controller’s buttons - The Qlist and Cue will be assigned to the Controller and default controller configuration and settings will be applied. See: 6.5.2. Controller Actions Release and unload Controllers: See: 13.8. Controller Release and Free 13.8 Controller Release and Free Vibe has two types of release functions, Editor Release and Controller Release. The following deals with Controller Release. Off - Instantly turns off a controller [OFF] [HERE] to any controller button. Release - Turns off a controller using release time. [RELEASE] [HERE] to any controller button. Release All - Turns off all controllers using release time. [VIBE] + [RELEASE] Release Time - By default controllers use the Default Release Time set in System Settings Timing. See: 6.2. Timing Release time may also be set on a Qlist basis using the Qlist Properties Pop-up. See: 6.5.3. Qlist Properties Free - Unloads a controller. It does not delete the loaded object. [FREE] [HERE] to any controller button. Free All - Unloads all controllers. [VIBE] + [FREE] 13.9 Controller Qlist Properties By default, the first incident of a Qlist being assigned to a controller will take its Qlist properties from the user default Qlist Properties. For Qlist Properties details, see: 6.5.3. Qlist Properties Each new incident of assigning the same Qlist to additional controllers will initially copy the Qlist properties from the first assignment. If changes are made to individual controller Qlist properties, those changes stay with the controller and are not copied or updated to other controller Qlist properties. If it is desirable to update what will be copied to future assignments of the Qlist, toggle {Save to Qlist} On. Changes made to the current Qlist properties will now be passed along. Qlist properties may be restored to their user defaults by tapping the {Restore Defaults} key. 13.10 Controller Modes The Controller Mode keys are located at the far left of the console beside the motorized faders. The motorized faders may be assigned to any one of 4 modes. These modes allow for a quick modification to various rate and effect parameters. Controller modes are outside of the editor and are designed for “On the Fly” usage. Controller Modes allow the following to be adjusted: [FADERS] - Normal behavior for the fader as assigned in Controller Definitions [RATE] - The Rate of the fades, loops, effects, and chasers on the controller will be proportionally adjusted. Motorized faders will move to an optimized position of 32% allowing for proportional adjustment of a controller’s rate. [SIZE] - Proportionally adjusts the size of effects running on the controller. [OFFSET] - Adjusts the spread of the fixtures in running effects [PROTECT] - When implemented, must be held down before any of the fader modes may be changed. 13.11 Rate and Teach Keys The Rate function allows users to adjust controller rates or effects parameters in “real time”. This is very helpful in fine tuning chases and effects to synchronize with music, or to improvise performances “on the fly”. The Rate Screen operates outside of the editor and is non destructive. Changes made in the Rate Screen may not be stored in cues but may be stored and recalled in [Snaps]. Using the Rate Screen: Large encoder wheels: Press the [Rate Key] - When opened, all loaded controllers will appear in the “Selected Controllers” section of the display. Initially all loaded controllers will be globally affected by the wheels and features in the Rate Screen. Pressing any [Key] of a controller will deselect all other controllers except the controller that was selected. Additional controllers may be toggled on or off as desired and they will appear in the selected Controllers display. {Select All} will reselect all loaded controllers for rate control. {Deselect All} will release all selected controllers from rate control {Show Active} will release all controllers in the “Selected Controllers” section that are not currently under the control of the rate wheels. Wheel 1 - {Controller Rate} speeds up or slows down the cross fade rate of the controller. This may be used for cue transitions, chases, or effects. Range: 0% (Stopped) ⟶ 3000% (effectively cut time) Wheel 2 - {X Fade %} adjusts the “fade vs jump percent of a chaser. Range: 0% (full jump) ⟶ 100% (full cross fade) Wheel 3 - {Intensity Limit} proportionally limits the intensity output of a controller. Range 0% (no intensity output) ⟶ 100% {Intensity controller full} Wheel 4 - {Library Editor Rate} currently unimplemented (adjusts the speed that Libraries are faded into the editor) Small encoder wheels: (top to bottom) Small encoder wheels: (top to bottom) Small Wheel 1 - {FX Rate} adjusts the rate of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 2 - {FX Size} adjusts the size of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 3 - {FX Offset} adjusts the offset (Spread) of effects that are running on the selected controllers. Small Wheel 3 - {FX Base} adjusts the base values (start point) of parameters that are in running effects on the selected controllers. Reset keys: {Reset Ctrl Rate} - Sets all controller rates back to their default of 100% {Reset FX Rate} - Sets controlled FX rates back to their stored values. {Reset FX Size} - Resets controlled size of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Offset} - Resets controlled offsets of effects back to their stored values. {Reset FX Base} - Resets controlled effects base values back to their stored values. Freeze toggle keys: {Freeze All} - Pauses all running chases and effects until the {Freeze All} key is toggled again. {Freeze Chase} - Pauses all running chases until the {Freeze Chase} key is toggled again. {Freeze Effect - Pauses all running effects until the {Freeze Effect} key is toggled again. Freeze only effects chases and effects at the playback level. To permanently release an effect from a cue see: 12.3.1. Building Effects Using the Advanced Effects Editor Transport Bar: When actively in the Rate Screen, physical controller keys are mapped to the rate interface and may not be used to activate Qlists, cues, or scenes. As an alternative, the transport bar may be used. To use the transport bar: Tap {Enable Controller PB} to activate the Transport Bar. Select the controllers to control with the bar by toggling any of the controller’s physical control keys Use the transport Bar buttons to: {&lt;&lt;} Step Back {|&lt;} Back {||} Hold (Pause) {&gt;} GO {&gt;&gt;} Step Forward {Release} may be tapped at any time to deactivate the selected controllers using release time. Teach keys: Currently unimplemented {Teach Enabled} - Enables the [Teach Key] for sampling and adjusting tap rate of chasers and effects in “real time”. {Tap X} keys set the sample rate for the teach function (number of presses to be averaged). When implemented, Teach time may also be set from the Rate Screen using the transport bar buttons. 13.12 Playback Master A Playback Master is a controller that masters other controllers. LED and theme color for the playback master object is blue. Any key command on the master will be triggered on the controlled Playbacks (GO, BACK, etc.). Any fader behavior movement becomes a master to the other sliders (rate, intensity, etc.). Playback Masters can also be stored in snaps. To Set Up a Master PB Press [PLAYBACK] Tap [MASTER] from the toolbar Select the playbacks to be mastered by pressing any of their keys Press [STORE] Press any key of the Controller you wish to be the Master. 13.13 Move Controllers Implemented MOVE function on controllers. Use the Move button to rearrange the controllers. A controller can be moved to any other controller, even if it’s a different type. The controller will be moved with all its settings and state, including intensity value etc. Attention: moving a Slider controller with intensity &lt;&gt; 100% to a QKey controller will make it not possible to change the intensity of this object since there is no fader for QKey controller.

Look Ahead (Move in Dark) 14.2. Look Ahead Cue (Mark) 14.3. Force Black 14.1 Look Ahead (Move in Dark) The Look Ahead feature is used for automatic pre-positioning of selected parameters when the fixture’s dimmer is dark, thus avoiding visible p r meter movement. For Look Ahead to work, the fixture’s dimmer must be at ZR, and there must be a parameter moves from one cue to the next cue. Look Ahead fades can be set for a specified default time or user time, which is different than the cue’s default fade time. Before using Look Ahead, you must create a Look Ahead mask. The Look Ahead mask tells Vibe which spots, spot parameters, or scrollers are affected by the Look Ahead feature. If you have not specified parameters in the Look Ahead mask, all parameters will be affected. The Look Ahead mask can contain more than one parameter. Currently, the Look Ahead pre-positioning will happen at the last available opportunity before the dimmer turns on. If in specific cues you want to prevent applying the Look Ahead mask, give dimmers a value of 1%. LED fixtures without physical dimmer parameters should not be included in the Look Ahead Mask. Enable or Disable Look Ahead on all controllers: Open System Settings from the Vibe Menu or tap the status area of the main monitor - The System Settings pop-up will open. Tap the {Timing} tab to open the Timing Properties pop-up. Under the Look Ahead header enable or disable all controllers using {Set All Controllers ON} or {Set All Controllers OFF}. There is no confirmation of On/Off as these buttons basically toggle {Look Ahead} in all Qlist Properties pop-ups. If Look Ahead is globally turned off it may still be enabled on a per Qlist basis in the Qlist Properties pop-up. Look Ahead status for individual controllers may be viewed in the controller’s Qlist Properties. Create the Look Ahead Mask: Select the fixtures to be in the Mask. Optionally select the parameters to be included in the Mask - If no parameters are selected, all parameters will be included. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [STORE]. Delete the Look Ahead Mask: Select the fixtures to be deleted from the Mask. Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar. Press [DELETE].

Press [Enter] or tap to close the pop-up. 14.2 Look Ahead Cue (Mark) Unimplemented Look Ahead: (sometimes referred to a Mark Cue) Unlike having Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in Cue Store Options as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just the tagged cue. 14.3 Force Black When it is not desirable to see parameter values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programing time. In a cue flagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first “forced” to Black Out, parameters them move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time. To flag a cue as a Force Black Cue: [QLIST [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS].

Lasso: Select by creating a free-form path, dragging through objects. De-select all. Delete selected (only valid in Edit Mode). Snap to Grid - Fixtures and object will snap to the nearest grid node. Sync to Editor - In edit mode, fixtures can be selected using the embedded keypad. Selection may be used in Live mode or Edit mode. All types of selection must start outside of the fixture icons. {Tools} - Accesses the smart adjustment options {Align}: Aligns the selected elements horizontally to the left, center or right, and vertically to the top, middle or bottom. The alignment can also be set on a circular or a square shape and between two points it is possible to adjust the element location on the shape, the radius and the ending point. {Align to Point}: A base point must be specified on the Topo surface as a starting reference. The options are the same as Align except there is no point to point. {Spread} (Fan): Spreads the selected elements horizontally from the left, center or right, and vertically from the top, middle or bottom. When Spread is selected, a virtual modifier wheel will appear. {Transform} - Modifies size and rotation of the objects to scale and rotate and to rotate of 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. The last icon is to resets the transform options. {Arrange by Calibration} - When tapped, selected Topo fixtures get their positions from the XYZ calibration. See chapter 19. XYZ Fixture Calibration. 18.3 Creating a Topo To create a new Topo: Navigate to a Topo view Tap the {} key in the Topo Menu at the right hand side of the Topo view display - The “Create New Topo” pop-up will appear Select the desired Topo number, and give the Topo a unique name.

This feature is under development and this section is preliminary. The following is covered in this section: 20.1. Basics 20.2. Configure Timecode 20.3. Timeline View 20.4. Record a Timeline 20.5. Edit Timeline Events 20.6. Execute Timeline Events 20.7. Markers 20.8. Time Format 20.1 Basics Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. There is no practice limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show but graphic performance may suffer with more than 16 Timeline Tracks. Each timeline may have its own timecode source. Vibe can read the following sources: Virtual Local - Internally generated timecode. Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI timecode received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console. USB MIDI class compliant timecode. MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol. Input sources from remote multi-User consoles and devices Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks. Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source. Supported frame rates are: 24 FPS 25 FPS 29.97 FPS drop-frame 30 FPS Vibe has Timecode connectors for the following: Audio input Combi Jack with: Female unbalanced line level input on 1/4” Phone jack Female 3 pin XLR balanced line level input. 5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI and MIDI timecode input. Additionally, the following general purpose ports may be used for Timecode: USB 2 and USB 3 ports can be used for USB class compliant MIDI over USB. Compulite devices that support MIDI over Ethernet can also be used. Recommended quality and level for SMPTE: SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended. As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, If long runs are to be used, it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance. 20.2 Configure Timecode To trigger a timeline with a timecode source, the Open the {Vibe} menu and select: {Settings} ⟶ {I/O Settings} A popup will open, where the connections and protocols can be configured and enabled or disabled. 1/O Settings Pop-up in Timecode Tab In General tab it is possible to enable or disable local and external midi connections. In Notes/Commands tab it is possible to assign specific commands to the midi notes. In Midi Show Control tab it is possible to enable and configure the MSC devices. In Timecode tab it is possible to enable and disable the Midi Time Code (MTC) and the SMPTE. Enable Timecode: From the patch toolbar tap {I/O Settings} For Tap {General} tab and select: {Local MIDI} to enable the DIN connector MIDI. {External MIDI} to enable USB MIDI or MIDI over Ethernet. Tap the {Timecode} tab, the Timecode pop-up will appear. Enable {MTC In} to enable any type of MIDI timecode input. Enable {SMPTE In} to receive LTC audio timecode. (Frames are automatically matched to the incoming frame rate} Currently, Vibe is only capable of being a timecode Slave but will be able to be the MIDI timecode Master in future releases. 20.3 Timeline View If no layout contains a Timeline view, the first step to create a Timeline is to add a Timeline View to the workspace layout. Unlimited timecode views may be created, but they will all be synchronized and show the same tracks and options. Timeline view with two timeline tracks, the cursor, and a marker To add a Timeline view to a page: Tap {Vibe} on the monitor that will display the Timeline - Vibe menu will open.

Tap the Lock/Unlock icon to enable adding a new view. Open the {Vibe} menu and select: {Program Views} ⟶ {Timeline View} A blank timeline view will appear on the workspace. Size and drag the Timeline view as required then tap {unlock/lock} icon to lock the Topo from further adjustment - The Timeline view is now ready to add tracks to. 20.4 Record a Timeline After a Timeline View has been created, timeline tracks may be recorded. Currently, timeline events are recorded in “real time” and then edited. To create a timeline track: Open the Timeline View menu. Tap {} - The “Create New Timeline” pop-up will open. Select a timeline number and name. Choose Start from {Blank} or {Existing} Timeline and Apply. Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source. Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock. Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console. Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device. Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button. Record overwrites existing events. (+) Record adds events to existing events. If using internal TC, press Play. If using external TC start the timecode source. The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controller’s events. When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.  Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events. Timeline Features To trigger Timeline commands via the panel and Editor Toolbar there is an “Active Timeline View” indicator: Grid View Filters Switch from the Graphical to the Grid view with the left button on the control bar.

What is MIDI 21.2. General MIDI Configuration 21.3 Configuring MIDI Notes and Commands 21.4. MIDI Show Control 21.5 MIDI Time Code 21.1 What is MIDI MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that was originally developed by the music industry to allow multiple MIDI sound devices to be triggered from just one source, usually a master keyboard or synthesizer. It is a control protocol and does not transmit audio. Over the years the MIDI protocol has evolved to also be a popular way to synchronize and “Play” lighting equipment. MIDI is based around a 7-bit architecture and therefore has a theoretical 127 possible notes for a keyboard. (Most pianos use 88 notes and synthesizers use even less) In the basic MIDI implementation it is possible to have: 16 independent MIDI channels - The channels systems listen on. 127 Note ONs - Pressing down on a keyboard. 127 Note OFFs - Lifting off a keyboard. Note On Velocity of 1 ⟶ 127 - How hard the key is struck. After Touch pressure of 0 ⟶ 127 - Ho muce pressure is applied after the key reaches the bottom. 127 controllers each with a range of 0 ⟶ 127 - Encoder wheels or faders. Patch changes from 0 ⟶ 127 - change from one instrument to another. Pitch bend wheel that has a 14-bit resolution. A section for MIDI time code, and other manufacturer’s “System Exclusive” information. In lighting, we often assign matching notes and controllers to common keys and wheels to synchronize playback. E.g. A GO Button on console A is configured to send Note #46, and a GO button on console B is configured to receive note #46. Pressing GO on console A console will press the GO on console B. In EDM shows, DJ’s frequently control lighting via MIDI touchpad controllers. MIDI Show Control or MSC - Not yet implemented is a significant Real Time System Exclusive extension of the international Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. MSC enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control. The MIDI Show Control protocol is an industry standard ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in 1991 which allows all types of entertainment control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications. Just like musical MIDI, MSC does not transmit the actual show media - it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance.. * Courtesy Wikipedia MIDI Time Code - Not yet implemented MIDI time code is similar to the SMPTE time code and is used to synchronize audio, video, and lighting equipment. Unlike SMPTE it does not use an audio signal. MIDI time code is available in the following frame rates: 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work) 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video) 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video) 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video) Vibe can receive MIDI time code but does not generate MIDI time code. Local MIDI: MIDI is generated and received from the 5 pin DIN connectors on the back of the console. MIDI over USB: Transmits and receives MIDI over standard USB connectors. The device must be MIDI over USB class compliant to work with Windows without a driver. If the device has a Windows driver available it is recommended to install the driver for optimal results. MIDI over Ethernet: Windows class compliant MIDI over Ethernet is supported. Compulite VC MIDI over Ethernet is also supported. 21.2 General MIDI Configuration I/O General: General configuring Vibe MIDI: Connect all appropriate MIDI devices and power them on.

Configure Timecode "],["media-servers.html", "Chapter 22 Media Servers 22.1 Media Bank", " Chapter 22 Media Servers The following is covered in this chapter: 22.1 - Media Bank 22.1 Media Bank There is a bank on the Small Screen Called Media. This bank was created to be able to handle media servers in a smart and easy way. In order to see content in this bank, users will need to create Media Server devices such as Green Hippo’s Hippotizer. All virtual controls are also mapped to the physical wheels for easy use. This bank has 5 types of sub-banks: Media – Media Bank This sub-bank includes a quick way to trigger media files from the media server. It shows all the folders and files inside the server and lets the user decide which one to play. By default, all the folders and subfolders are visible, but once synchronizing the data with the media server through CITP (see: CITP Popup then thumbnails will be shown. Media – FX (Effect) Bank This sub-bank includes the effects available on the media server. There are media servers with more than 1 effect engine (layer) and for each effect, there will be a numbered FX Bank button created. The FX Bank includes a list of effects that are possible to trigger on the server and a list of parameters to control the effect. The parameters will be dynamically changed according to the selected effect. Media – Keystone Bank This sub-bank includes a graphic interface to control the keystoning of the server. There are 4 points available for movement in order to control the position of each corner of the keystone control. The selected point that is assigned to the physical wheels is marked in red. Media – Generator Bank This sub- bank is specifically made for Hippotizer. On this bank, users can control the picture that is sent from the server’s layer on the Generator engine. The bank acts the same as the Media FX bank by selecting the Generator from the Generators list and then moving the Generator’s parameters accordingly. Media – Geometry Bank This sub-bank includes an interface to control most of the geometric functions of the media server. There are options to control: Aspect Mode of the layer. Zoom Rotation, Indexed or Rotating with speed control Aspect Ratio Positioning, both X and Y In addition there is a graphic preview to show the approximate result of the geometric parameters.

The following is covered in this chapter: 23.1. Network Basics 23.2. Connecting to Compulite ePorts 23.3. Connecting to Art-Net and sACN Nodes 23.4. RDM 23.5. CITP 23.6. OSC 23.1 Network Basics 23.1. Network Basics Vibe has two user accessible Ethernet networks: Data Network - Accessible via the two etherCON connectors on the rear panel. ◾ Used for Art-Net, sACN, Compulite VC protocol nodes and Master/Slave backup. General Networks - Accessible via the two RJ45 connectors on the rear panel. ◾ Used for Network storage of show files and remote diagnostics. Each network device must have its own unique static IP address in the form of four triplets xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, to identify it on the network. In Vibe, this can be set in the System Settings pop-up. It is not necessary to have three digits in each segment of the IP but there must be at least one digit in each segment. Vibe ships with a default Subnet Mask of 255.0.0.0 which means that it is only important that the first triplets of the IP, (the start address), must match on all devices in the network. Devices on the same network must not have identical IP addresses. Common Start addresses are: 10.x.x.x - Default for most ETC networks and alternate for Art-Net network IP. 2.x.x.x - Default for Art-Net networks. 192.x.x.x -Default for most MA consoles. Subnet Mask - Identifies the network itself and in conjunction with the IP address can be used to properly route network devices. 255.0.0.0. - Compulite Default. Only the first triplet must match. 255.255.0.0 - Also common. Compulite uses the third triplet as a console identifier in some of the products. The Vibe can be used in networks using a DHCP server but cannot act as a DHCP server. In all cases, the first triplets must match for devices to communicate with one another.. Switches: Vibe has two internal switches so single direct device to device connections are possible without a cross cable. When more than one device must be connected to the Vibe a good quality gigabit switch should be used. Many a system has gone down due to bad Ethernet cabling and cheap switches. It is recommended that etherCON connectors be used where possible in conjunction with professional grade switches designed for lighting and audio applications.. Network Properties Open the {NETWORK SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the Network Settings button - The Network pop-up will open. Local: Option to set the local information of the console such as IP and name. Console State: There are 2 possible individual states: Stand Alone (Default) – Console is not in a session but networking for outputs, remotes and external connections is active. Local (Offline) – Same as Stand Alone but disables the DMX over ethernet. User ID: Not yet implemented. Start Session: The console becomes a Master console, meaning it’s hosting a session. Later on this in the Master-Slave and Multiuser chapters. Online IP Devices: Displays all Valid IP based devices active on the network. Delete Selected / Clear Device IP History Can either select a device to remove from the list or clear the whole list. To clear Device IP History Open System Settings. Go to Network tab. Tap Clear IP Devices. Connect As … / Disconnect: Related to starting or ending a session with a master console. Later on this in the Master-Slave and Multiuser chapters. 23.2 Connecting to Compulite ePorts Compulite manufactures the ePort brand of DMX over Ethernet nodes. Supported Protocols: ePort 41 - Prior to Sept 2016 (check serial number with Compulite to confirm) ◾ Compulite VC protocol ◾ Art-Net v2 ePort-41 - Current ◾ sACN pre-release and release versions ◾ Art-Net 3 ◾ Compulite VC protocol ePort-8 and ePort-2 ◾ sACN pre-release and release versions ◾ Art-Net 3 ◾ Compulite VC protocol For more product information, See: ePort Documents Before an ePort can be connected it should be configured using the CNET Manager software, available at the above link. Configuring ePorts: Make sure that the Vibe IP and the ePort IP are in the same range. Assign universes to each physical port by typing the universe number in the box below the icon of the physical connector. Select the DMX- ON-Ethernet protocol in the protocol list below the graphical display of the ePort. If the ePort is a newer model, sACN will also appear in the list. If Art-Net is selected make sure the Art-Net Subnet is also set. In most cases this will be set to 0 which allows the first 16 universes. It must be incremented by one with each new range of 16 universes Tap {Update} to apply all changes. 23.3 Connecting to Art-Net and sACN Nodes Vibe currently supports transmission of 256 universes of DMX over Ethernet using the industry standards of Art-Net versions 1 ⟶ 3, ad eACN (ANSI E1.31-2016 standard). Enable Art-Net or sACN output: Open the {DMX SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu &gt; Settings or tap the DMX Settings button - The DMX Properties pop-up will open. Under the Protocol heading, Tap {Art-Net} or {sACN} - The selection will turn red. Under Broadcast Options (VC, Art-Net, sACN) tap {Out} - The status indicator light will turn green. The console will now be outputting the selected protocol on the etherCON Data ports. The Vibe is capable of transmitting more than one protocol at a time. To save bandwidth it is also possible to enable only the universes for each protocol that are required. Vibe has separate universe patches for VCs, Art-Net, and sACN. By default, universes are patched 1 to 1 for each protocol. It is possible to reroute universe output destinations. Normally fixtures patched to console source universe 1 would be transmitted on Ethernet destination universe 1 but sometimes when multiple consoles are on line it is desirable to reroute universes to avoid conflicts. Source universe 1 for example could be rerouted to destination universe 101. The Vibe is licensed for 64, 96, 128, or 255 console source universes but these universes may be freely rerouted to any destination universe from 0 ⟶ 256 providing the total amount of universes does not exceed the purchased license. Reroute Console Universes: Under the Source Universe header, scroll the list to the source console universe number you wish to route from. Once tapped, the selection will turn red. A universe number may also be typed from the keypad. Under the Destination Universe header, tap one of the cells in the destination universe grid. The source universe number will now be routed through the destination universe number. Additional functions: Clear a destination universe - Tap {Universe #} in the destination grid. Tap {Clear}. Clear all destination universes - Select the protocol to clear. Tap {Clear All}. Reset default route for a single destination universe - Tap {Universe #} Tap {Config}. Reset all defaults for the selected protocol - Tap {Config All}. Art-Net Subnet View: Art-Net is designed in blocks of 16 universes. The blocks starts at subnet 0 and increments by 1 every 16 universes. The Subnet number and fixture number in the subnet may be viewed by toggling {Subnet View}. Unicast Option for Art-Net and VC It is possible to set specific IPs to send the output to. If there is a port configured to a specific IP it will not be sent broadcast. Ports that are not defined as unicast will be still sent as broadcast. Each port can be configured to multiple IPs. Few ports can be sent to the same IP. To configure Unicast send Tap Vibe menu button Tap Settings button Tap DMX Settings button Go to VC’s Out or Art-Net Change the toggle to Unicast Settings Tap Add to add a new configuration line On the first line – ports 1 ⟶ 5 will be sent to IP 172.16.10.10 On the second line – port 5 will be sent also to IP 172.16.10.11 On the third line – ports 6 ⟶ 10 will be sent to IP 172.16.10.12 23.4 RDM Currently, RDM is fully supported on the 8 physical DMX output ports and Compulite VC protocol. View RDM information: Open Patch Workspace. Tap the RDM tab in the lower right corner of the workspace. Tap {Get Devices} - The system will scan and display RDM compliant devices. If new devices are added, press {Re Scan}. Full RDM management will be available in future releases. 23.5 CITP CITP Popup This popup gathers all the CITP capabilities of the Vibe together. To open the CITP Popup Tap Vibe menu button In Settings, Tap CITP Settings In the popup there are 4 tabs: General CITP Settings This tab shows the general information about the console and gives the option to enable/disable CITP communication from/to this console. Media Servers This tab shows a list of the detected Media Servers on the network. In order to connect to a media server and start a session, select a media server from the list and press Connect. In order to link a media server to a specific fixture, select a connected media server from the list and tap Configure. A popup will appear where you can choose which fixtures you want to link. In order to get all the available data from a media server, select a connected and linked media server from the list, and tap Get Data. All available data such as thumbnails, effects etc. will be synced from the media server to the fixtures on your show. Visualizers This tab shows a list of the detected Visualizers on the network. In order to connect to a visualizer and start a session, select it from the list and tap Connect. In order to get the patch from a connected visualizer, select it from the list and tap Get Show. This action will clear the current show, get the devices, fixtures, numbers, patch, XYZ information from the visualizer and automatically create it on your show. Consoles This tab shows a list of the detected consoles on the network that are using CITP and their state. Auto Patch from Capture It is possible to sync the show from Capture. In order to do that you need to set the Capture CITP settings to use Standard Multicast and select the relevant IP address. In addition, make sure Vibe and Capture are on the same subnet. After finishing preparing the show on Capture, go to Vibe, open the CITP popup, enable the CITP and connect to the Capture from the Visualizers tab. Then Get Data from Capture and you should be ready to go. Capture Protocol It is possible to choose which output protocol will be listened by Capture while in a CITP session. 23.6 OSC What is OSC OSC (Open Sound Control) is a protocol for networking with sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices for purposes such as musical performance or show control. OSC enables a text string based exchange of commands and triggers between different devices via a network connection, that is used to establish the synchronization between different systems. Connections with OSC can use TCP or UDP protocol for direct communication over the network. OSC Input Vibe supports the OSC input protocol, using TCP, UDP, or both. In the I/O settings popup there is the list of supported OSC strings as well as OSC ports and protocols. OSC strings can be customized by the user. IMAGE TO ADD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; OSC Output Vibe supports the OSC input protocol, using TCP, UDP, or both. The OSC view shows the existing commands, allowing the user to create and edit custom commands, and to send immediate commands and use keyboard arrows to re-send commands from the cache. OSC commands can be attached to Cues with the syntax: [QLIST, #, CUE, #, ATTACH_OSC (toolbar)]. IMAGE TO ADD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; "]]
