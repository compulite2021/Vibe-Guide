The following is covered in this chapter: 1.1. Unboxing 1.2. Getting Started 1.3. Guide Conventions 1.4. Important Terms 1.1 Unboxing TBA. 1.2 Getting Started Power requirements:  Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz.  Approximately 3.2 amps at 230V.  Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country. Desk Light:  Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console.  Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Monitor intensity:  Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. Power up the console:  Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks.  Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector.  Press the Power button located at the upper right corner of the monitor panel above the USB connectors.  The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch. Power down the console:  Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open.  Tap { Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} Pop-up will appear.  Tap {Yes} or {No}.  The Vibe application will shutdown and a screen will appear with the following options: {Shut Down the Console} - System will power off {Restart Vibe} - Vibe console application will restart {Open Offline Tool} - the Vibe utilities app will open. Hardware and software updates are preformed in the Offline Tools app. Choose Shut Down the Console - The console will safely power off. 1.3 Guide Conventions  [XXXX] - Physical key  {XXXX} - Soft key § [ ] { } - Example  Press - Action applied to a physical key  Tap - Action applied to softkey or virtual key  Toggle - Action that actives and deactivates with alternating taps or presses  Key - Any physical or virtual key that is NOT used for controller activation  Button - Any virtual or physical key that is used to activate a controller  Keypad - Embedded numeric keypad  Keyboard - Consoles pull-out ASCII keyboard or any external keyboard  SK - Object softkeys (Libraries, Groups, Snap, Macros, etc.)   - Hint or suggestion  RED - Important information or Caution  [Here] - Short form for Press an appropriate destination softkey or controller button to complete the command 1.4 Important Terms DMX 512 Output/Input Port - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter. DMX 512 Universe - Virtual DMX outputs 0  256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols.  Compulite VC protocol  w Art-Net 3 w  sACN SET = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets), 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures), 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors), 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures), 4 = Servers (Video servers), 5  1000 = User defined sets Parameter - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo. Controllers - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots. Submaster - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value. Master Controller - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys. Slider - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader. Qkey - A single button Controller. Assert - Takes back control of parameters that have been robbed by other controllers. HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence) - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications. LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence) - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output its values to the stage no matter what the value. [SELECT] - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller. Qlist - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999. Cue - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values. Scene - A look that exists independent of a Qlist. Library - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced. Options - Used to modify object properties on the fly Settings - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created. Cue Zero - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid. For the sake of this guide, Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function.

Parameter Mode - 4.7.2. Bank Mode - 4.7.3. Fixture Mode 4.1 Introduction Vibe uses a Multi-touch based interface with simple familiar gestures for navigation. Supported gestures:  Two fingers for swipe and scrolling.  One finger select.  Multi-selection via shaped gestures.  Multi-selection via window. Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added using DisplayPort 1.2 or higher MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large 21 embedded screen is general-purpose like the external monitors. The smaller 11.6 Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive parameter information such as color pickers and gobo pickers. Each monitor, (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain one Window Frame. Window frames can contain one of three Workspace Templates. Each Template has a dedicated display in the lower area. This area will have different fixed options and information depending on the selected Workspace Template. The remainder of the template may be freely customized by the user. Each Template can contain up to 4 Pages that can be toggling using the WorkSpace Template Keys or by tapping the yellow {VIBE} Menu key at the bottom left of each Workspace Template and tapping the {PAGES} key to the right of the {VIBE} key to open the pages display. Each Monitor (excluding the Smart Screen) can contain its own independent set of WorkSpace Templates. Workspace Templates are organized into three familiar categories, each with a dedicated display key. These keys are found above the top left corner of the Smart Screen:  PATCH  [PROG] - (Program)  [PLAY-B] - (Playback Controllers) The Workspace Template Keys are specific to the monitor that has focus (last touched or selected via a mouse). The Patch Template by default has a fixed command line and patch tool bar at the bottom, and a pre-built patch display on page 1. Except for the bottom toolbar, the patch display may be freely customized via the {VIBE} Menu. The Program Template contains a command line and fixed display of the 15 motorized Slider controllers. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the {VIBE} Menu. The controller display may be toggled to display the Qkey controller display using the [SWAP DISPLAY] key at the top left corner of the controller panel. The Playback Template contains a command line and a fixed display of both the 15 motorized fader controllers and the 15 Qkey controllers at the same time. Everything above this fixed display is user customizable via the {VIBE} Menu. The controller displays may be swapped to display the Qkey controllers on the bottom row via the [SWAP DISPLAY] key at the top left corner of the controller panel. 4.2 {VIBE} Menu The {VIBE} Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped sub-menus. It is used to access common system functions such as Save and System Settings as well as configure Workspace Template displays. Configuring WorkSpaces: When configuring workspaces, any object at the end of the hierarchical sub-menu can be tapped to open its object on a blank portion of the current workspace or dragged and dropped to the workspace surface. Once on the surface it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. If an object is dragged on top of another both will turn green and become one tabbed object. To edit the placement of objects, the {Lock} icon beside the {VIBE} menu key must be toggled to unlock the workspace display. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the display and allow normal usage. 4.3 Layouts Layouts: After all workspaces and associated pages are configured, the display configurations of the workspaces can be saved to a Layout by tapping the {VIBE} Menu and then the {LAYOUT} key. A Sub-menu will open with options to {SAVE LAYOUT}, {LOAD LAYOUT}. After configuring external monitors, a layout should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layouts remember the configuration of external monitors and a warning message will appear if the system is booted without the expected external monitor. 4.4 Smart Screen The 11.6 multi-touch monitor embedded in the upper section of the Vibe console is referred to as the Smart Screen. The Smart Screen is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive bank, wheel, and parameter information. For more detail see: 9.3.4 Smart Screen 4.5 Toolbars The Editor Toolbar contains is a set of interactive Softkeys that are used to access less common commands: The Patch Toolbar contains two pages of options:  Idle state toolbar  Fixture selection state toolbar 4.6 Live Display Vibe has two ways to display parameter data: 1) Live Display - Displays cue and editor data as a spreadsheet. 2)Live Parameter Display - shows values in a table format instead of spreadsheet format. Live Display The Live Display has a number of options that may be set under the Options field: - Opens Live View Settings. (See 4.6.1.Live View Settings.) Fit - Opens column width options.  Fit to Window  Fit to Value  Fix by Text  Default Active on Stage - Only parameter columns that are selected in the editor or have values derived from the active stage look are shown. All others are hidden. Sets - Select which of the fixture sets to display.  Fixture s Channel  Spot s Matrix  Media Server  Other custom Sets if created Format - Controls what format the data is displayed in.  % - Values in percentage  Decimal - DMX values 0 à 255  Text - Parameter step text  Text + Percentage 4.7 Live Parameter Display Live View Settings pop-up - Display Tab. Live View Scheme - Parameter columns may be freely added, removed, moved in using the Live View Scheme. Move columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings -the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt; } or {&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column forward or backwards. Move columns to the first or last column position: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings -the green indicator light will turn on. Use the {|&lt;&lt; } or {&gt;&gt;|} keys to move the parameter column first position or last position. Remove columns: Tap a parameter column heading or multiple parameter column headings -the green indicator light will turn on. Tap the {Remove} key. Dock - Locks the column scroll at the end of the parameter column that is docked. A red line will show on the live display to show the dock position. (Group By Banks and All icons in 1 cell are not implemented yet) Add Columns - Columns are added using the Banks section of the pop-up. Select a bank - All parameters for the bank will appear in the box adjacent to the banks. Select the parameter or parameters to add to the live display.  Swipe in the the parameter box to browse hidden parameters. Tap a parameter that is not already selected in green and it will be added to the end of the column list. Parameter keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching the parameter will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. Use the {|&lt; } or {&gt;|} {|&lt;&lt; } or {&gt;&gt;|} to position the column. Interactive Icons:  Adds or removes the icon columns. Interactive Icon keys are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. General:  Global Fixture Number - Fixtures hidden unique system number.  Fixture Layer Number - Adds or removes Fixture Number column.  Fixture Name - Adds or removes Fixture Name column. Fixture # and Fixture Name are toggles so if the indicator light is on, touching an icon key will remove it. Tapping again will put it back at the end of the columns. Live View Settings pop-up - Behavior Tab Fixture Jumping:  Off  Jump if needed - live display pages the display to show the selected fixtures if they are not shown on the current live page.  Lowest Selection to Top - Jumps the lowest fixture number of the selection to the top of the live display. Parameter Jumping:  Jumps the parameters column and related bank parameters to the end of the dock position. (First scrollable column). Interactive Fixture Selection:  Turns on the ability to make fixture selections from the live display grids. Interactive Cell Editing:  Turns on the ability to directly edit cells in the live display grid. Interactive Header selection - Currently implemented but may not be turned off.  Enables parameters to be directly selected from the live display headers. Submaster Values:  Show Stored Values - Dimmer parameters under the control of Group Submasters will continue to show their stored values and the icon will also be shown to indicate when the parameter is inhibited.  Show Output Values - When the Submaster is pulled down, the actual dimmer output values will be shown in the live display dimmer column. 4.8 Parameter Mode Unlike most theatrical consoles, parameters other than dimmer may be shown in Live Parameter Mode. Parameters visible in Live Parameter Mode are filtered using the Parameter View Settings Pop-up. Filter Parameters: Tap the icon - The Parameter View Settings pop-up will open. Tap parameters on either side to move them from one box to the other. Close the pop-up using [ENTER] or . 4.9 Bank Mode Fixtures may also be graphically displayed by banks. Currently, three banks can be graphically viewed: Image will be implemented soon. Intensity - In the form of an illuminated disk. Position - In the form of a cursor that moves in a black rectangle representing the stage. Color - In the form of a circular color swatch - Color wheels are not currently supported. 4.10 Fixture Mode Graphically Displays Intensity, Position, and Color parameter icons as a single tombstone fixture "],["file-management.html", "Chapter 5 File Management 5.1 Show Menu 5.2 Load Vector Show", " Chapter 5 File Management This chapter provides an overview of Vibes Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Modify Patch - 6.5. Configuring Physical DMX 1/0 - 6.6. Patching Inputs - 6.7. Parking Addresses and Fixtures 6.1 Fixture Sets Like other lighting consoles, Vibe contains an extensive Device Library with DMX parameter mapping for fixtures, media servers, and common miscellaneous devices like smoke machines. Before a device can be programmed it must be imported and patched to DMX addresses. Vibe has an advanced numbering system that allows devices to be grouped into five familiar categories called SETS. Custom SETS may also be created. Numbering in all sets may be freely changed if there are no overlapping numbers. Each Set has a unique ID. Set ID numbers: 0 = [Fixture] is a special global numbering set that must also reference one of the other sets. All devices must be assigned a Fixture number and one of the other set numbers. 1 = [Channel] is a numbering set that would normally be used for conventional single parameter devices. 2 = [SPOT] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for multi-parameter devices like moving lights. 3 = [MATRIX] is a numbering set that would mainly be used for RGB or other non-moving LED fixtures. (also useful in pixel mapping devices) 4 = [SERVER] is a numbering system used for media servers. Each SET may have Fixtures numbered from 1  999999 To patch a device, you must first move focus to the main monitor and press the PATCH Workspace Template key. By default, the first page will contain all the displays needed for patching. 6.2 Import Devices Once the Patch Workspace is open: Make sure the {Imported Devices} tab just above the white FIXTURE selection display area at the bottom left of the workspace is selected. Tap {Import}, the Manufactures picker list will appear. Flick or drag along the list to browse to the desired manufacturer then tap the manufacturers name. A new list and search window will open. If the exact device name is known, type it in the search window, if not flick or drag to browse the list until the desired device is found. The &lt; key may be pressed at any time to return to the Imported Devices list. . 6.3 Advanced Search Fixtures may be searched directly by name using the Advanced Device Search. Searches may also be filtered by parameter order and DMX Channel Count to limit the search. The filters are very helpful in finding close matches for fixtures that are not currently in the device library. To access Advanced Search: Tap {Import} from the main page - The tab will now read {Advanced Search}. Tap {Advanced Search} - The Advanced Search Pop-up will appear. Type the fixtures name in the Fixture Name box or Set the filters to limit the selection. Select the fixture from under the Matching Devices header. The DMX Modes pop-up will open. Review the DMX implementation and select the desired mode. Tap or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and add the fixture to the Imported Devices list. 6.4 Create and Patch imported fixtures Import the desired device. (See 6.2. Import Devices). The device will now be in the list below the Imported Devices header. Tap the device you wish to patch and the Create and Patch Fixtures popup will appear. In the Create and Patch fixtures pop-up, type the quantity in the red highlighted field via the keypad or flick/drag to browse the list until the desired quantity number is found then tap the number. If the Quantity number is not highlighted in Red, tap the field to make it active. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap in the {SET} field. The appropriate SET for the selected fixture should automatically be selected, but as some fixtures dont always cleanly fit into standard categories, check that the correct Set is selected. If not, flick/drag to browse to the correct SET then tap it. You may also type the Set number (0-5). Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the {Set Number} field. Set the Channel, Spot, Matrix, or Server number for the fixture in the red highlighted field using the keypad or scroll to browse the list until the desired start number is found, then tap the number.  By default, the first available number for the selected SET is pre-assigned. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any box in the Fixture Number field to select it. By default, the same number as the SET Number will appear as the Fixture Number. Many users like to group Fixtures by 10s or 100s so it is common to type 101 for the start of one type of fixture, 201 for a second type and so on. The SET number and Fixture number do not have to be the same. Next to the Fixture Number field is a data entry box that displays the fixtures default short name. This may be edited at any time while in this pop-up. The name will be updated when the fixtures are created upon closing the pop-up. In the second section of the pop-up, fixtures that were selected for creation can be patched via the DMX patch wizard. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap a number in the UNIVERSE field. If the desired universe is not visible, flick/drag to browse to the correct universe number then tap it. Press the  key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any number in the ADDRESS field. By default, the interval between fixtures of the same type is fixed. Using the INTERVAL field, a custom interval may be set. To complete CREATE and PATCH tap the {APPLY &amp; CONTINUE} key in the bottom right corner of the pop-up, Press [ENTER], or tap to close the pop-up and return to the patch workspace. Theatrical Multi-Patching can also be done manually using keypad syntax:  Toggle off the {MAIN PATCH} key at the top of the DMX patch wizard before closing the pop-up. The fixtures will be created but will remain unpatched. To Patch fixtures using traditional keypad syntax:  [FIXTURE] [#] [ADDRESS] [#].[#] ( By default, the first available DMX address of the selected Universe will be shown in the ADDRESS field. If the default start address is not appropriate, type or scroll the list to the desired start address and tap it.Universe.Address), [STORE]. Or  [ADDRESS] [#].[#] +/ -  [#].[#] [FIXTURE] [#] [STORE]. Addresses may also be typed in absolute format: 1  32,768 (64 Universes standard). The system will automatically assign the correct universe When starting from a {New Show} only {Physical DMX outputs} are enabled. Network universes must be enabled in PATCH {DMX Settings} 6.4.1 Drag and Drop Patch Drag and Drop Patch - If {Main Patch} is toggled off in the Create and Patch pop-up, fixtures can be created but not patched. Created fixtures may then be dragged and dropped onto the Universe View. Drag and Drop from the Fixtures tab: Create fixtures - (See 6.4. Create and patch imported fixtures). Select the Fixture Set you wish to patch from in the lower right of the main patch workspace. Select the Fixtures tab on the left side of the main patch workspace directly above the white FIXTURE selection box. A list of created fixtures will appear. Make sure the Universes View tab at the bottom of the main patch workspace is selected. Select a destination Universe from the Universes list in the top right of the main patch workspace. - Scroll the list to browse for hidden universes. Press and Hold a fixture, it will turn into a floating icon of the fixture. Drag the fixture icon from the Fixtures list onto the Universe View grid. All associated DMX addresses for the fixture will turn green. Drop the fixture icon on the desired DMX start address for the fixture. - The fixture is now patched. Multiple fixtures may be selected by swiping  or  in the Fixtures list. Make multiple selections of fixtures using the keypad: Type a range of fixtures using the keypad - the fixture selection will be displayed numerically in the white fixture selection box. Press and Hold anywhere in the white fixture selection box - a fixture icon will appear. Drag the icon to the Universe View grid and drop it at the destination start address - the range of fixtures is now patched. Multi-Patch using Drag and Drop: Drag and drop the same fixture to multiple DMX offsets. All types of fixtures may be multi-patched but caution should be used when multi-patching multi-parameter fixtures. Unpatch fixtures using drag and drop: Press and Hold any patched DMX offset - The DMX addresses for the fixtures patched to it will turn green and a fixture icon will be shown. Drag the selected block of fixtures towards the bottom of the screen - a waste basket icon will appear at the bottom of the workspace. Drag the block until the fixture icon is over the waste basket and release the fixture - the fixture will now be unpatched. 6.4.2 Modify Patch Once patched fixtures can be modified using keypad syntax or using the two Patch Toolbars in the Patch Workspace. Toolbar with no fixture selection:  {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens up Clear Patch pop-up.  {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up.  {ADD FIXTURE} - Opens the Create And Patch pop-up.  {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens up Delete Fixtures pop-up. Toolbar with fixture selection:  [FIXTURE] [#] {PATCH} - Opens up Patch Fixture pop-up.  [FIXTURE] [#] {RENUMBER} - Opens up RENUMBER: FIXTURE pop-up with fixture already selected.  [FIXTURE] [#] {FIXTURE CALIBRATION} - Opens up Fixture Calibration pop-up with the fixture selected. See: 20. XYZ Fixture Calibration  [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens the Clear Patch confirmation popup  [FIXTURE] [#] {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens the Delete Fixture confirmation pop-up Modify the patch using keypad syntax:  [FIXTURE] [#] {CLEAR PATCH} - From the Editor toolbar.  [FIXTURE] [#] [DELETE] - Only works in the Patch Workspace. 6.5 Configuring Physical DMX 1/0 By default, DMX is mapped to the physical ports on a 1:1 basis. DMX is always transmitted but can be remapped to anyone of the supported 256 DMX universes. Remap Physical outputs: With no fixtures selected, tap {DMX SETTINGS} on the patch toolbar - The DMX Properties pop-up will open. In the Protocol column, Tap {Physical output}. Under the Source Universe heading, tap the desired source universe number or once red type the universe number you wish to be the source. Under the Physical output Destination Universe heading, tap one of the 8 displayed physical outputs - the source Universe will now be patched to the output. Change output to input - Currently, Vibe supports 2 inputs but multiple connectors may be assigned to the same input. Tap a patched output - Two additional options will appear below the Output Destination Universe box.  {Make Input 1} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 1. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input.  {Make Input 2} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 2. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. Change input back to output: Tap a patched input - an additional Make Output option will appear below the Output Destination Universe box. Tap {Make Output} - The Connector will now output DMX. Change DMX refresh rate:  Vibe will always transmit DMX at the fastest refresh rate it can (38 - 44Hz). Sometimes older equipment cannot handle the high refresh rate, so it may be reduced using the DMX Max Rate wheel. It is not recommended to go below 28Hz as some jitter may be observed. 6.6 Patching Inputs The following objects may be mapped to DMX inputs: - DMX input mapped directly to the consoles DMX outputs - DMX input mapped to Macros - DMX input mapped to Controllers - DMX input mapped to fixtures Map a DMX output to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [ADDRESS] [#] Press [STORE] E.g. [ADDRERSS] [1] {INPUT PATCH TO} [ADDRESS] [1] [STORE] - When DMX 1 is received from an external source like a console, DMX 1 will directly output to the Vibes DMX output. No values will be shown in the live display as no actual parameters are involved. Map a range of DMX outputs to a range of DMX inputs: Press [ADDRESS] [#]  [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [ADDRESS] [#]  [#] Press [STORE] Map a Macro to a DMX input - Macro will trigger at 50% Press [ADDRESS] [#].[#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [MACRO] [#] Press [STORE] Map a controller to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO. Press [PLAY-B] (Controller) - The Controller Selection pop-up will appear. Choose the Controller Type, Page Number, and Controller number from the pop-up. Press ENTER, or tap to close the pop-up and complete the patch. Map a Fixture to a DMX input: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [Fixture] [#] Press [STORE] DMX inputs will automatically be mapped to all the fixtures parameters starting at the specified address. [ADDRESS] [1] [FIXTURE] [1] (A fixture with 42 parameters) [STORE] will automatically match the 42 parameters to input addresses 1  42. The next fixture would have to be mapped starting at address 43. Delete a DMX Input patch assignment: Press [ADDRESS] [#] Tap {INPUT PATCH TO} on the toolbar - Command line will say INPUT PATCH TO Press [DELETE] 6.7 Parking Addresses and Fixtures Park an Address: [ADDRESS] [#] {PARK} - The Park pop-up will appear.

"],["system-default-settings.html", "Chapter 7 System Default Settings 7.1 Editing 7.2 Timing 7.3 Network 7.4 Hardware 7.5 Defaults 7.6 System", " Chapter 7 System Default Settings This chapter deals with customizing system settings to suit programming styles. The following is covered in this chapter: - 7.1. Editing - 7.2. Timing - 7.3. Network - 7.4. Hardware - 7.5. Defaults - 7.5.1. Controller Settings - 7.5.2. Controller Actions - 7.5.3. Qlist Properties - 7.5.4. Chaser Properties - 7.5.5. Cue Settings - 7.5.6. Cue Store Options - 7.5.7. Scene Settings - 7.5.8. Scene Store Options - 7.5.9. Bank Library Options - 7.5.10. Snap Settings - 7.6. System 7.1 Editing System Settings defaults are accessed by selecting {System Settings} from the {Vibe} menu or by tapping the {System Status} area at the far right side of the controller displays. Editing Properties - Editing Section Default Stage Value: Home Value - When released, fixtures parameters will return to their home values as specified in the devices definition or user Home Scene. Maintain Last Value - When released, fixture parameters will remain at their current position but dimmer will go out. Auto Parameter Grouping: When on, parameters are grouped as follows: Clear Editor After Store: Default editor behaviour when in Compulite Mode - After storing a cue, values remain in the editor until [RESET] or [VIBE]+[RESET] is pressed. Editor Flash: Sets default values for toolbar {FLASH} feature. {Base} = Start point (low value) {Time} = Flash duration {Size} = Amplitude (high values) Defaults - {Base} 0.2 (20%) {Time} 2 seconds {Size} 0.6 (80%) Apply Compulite Mode: - Sets a number of defaults to emulate traditional nontracking Compulite Mode. Default Stage Values = {Maintain Last Value} {Clear Editor After Store} = Off {Advance To Cue After Store} = Off Qlist Behavior = {Non-Tracking} _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Editing Properties: - Cueing Section Tracking - Non-Tracking: Tracking On:  Values track forward. The stage look is made up of a combination of hard and tracked values. Non-Tracking:  Only hard values are recorded and zero dimmer values is treated as a hard zero. In Non-Tracking mode, parameter values that are not given values will still output to the stage where they were last left. This can accidentally lead to mistakes where when played back, the cue does not look the same as it did when it was recorded. It is suggested that the Store Options {All Parameters if Active} or {All Parameters if Selected} are used whenever possible to avoid errors. Clear Editor on Master GO: The editor will be reset when GO on the Master Controller is pressed. Store Scene by Default: By default [STORE] [HERE] (press any controller button) will create and assign the first available Scene to the controller instead of a Qlist and Cue. Qlists may then be stored by using the syntax [STORE] [CUE] [HERE] (press any controller button). Next Cue Increment: When [Store] [Here], [STORE] [STORE], or [STORE] [ENTER] are used to append a new cue to the end of a Qlist, the specified spacing will be used. E.g. If the increment is 1 and the last cue is 10, the new cue would be 11. If the increment is 10, then the new cue would be 20. Editing Properties: - ON Value Virtual wheel sets the default editor value for the dimmer parameter when the [ON] key is pressed. {First ON Recalls Last} - Pressing [ON] the first time will copy the last dimmer value set for a fixture into the next selected fixture. Pressing again will set the dimmer value to the ON default. Restore and Save Defaults: {Restore Popup Positions} - Currently redundant. {Restore Defaults} - Restores settings changes to the last time {Apply to Defaults} was set. {Restore Factory} - Restores console to read only defaults. {Apply to Defaults} -Updates system setting changes to show specific defaults without exiting the pop-up. 7.2 Timing Timing Properties - Cue Section Default Back Time: Timing is used when the [Back] or [Hold Back] Buttons are pressed. Default Assert: Timing is used when a controllers parameters are reasserted with the [ASSERT] [HERE] command. Use Cue Time - As the Assert command is basically a GOTO command to the same cue that is active, the cue time for the cue being reasserted may be used instead of the Default Assert time. Default GOTO Time: Default timing when the GOTO command is used. GOTO time can be overridden using command [GOTO] [CUE] [#] [TIME] [Value]Press or [ENTER]. Default Release Time: Default Fade out time for parameters being released from the editor using the [RESET], parameter [RELEASE] keys, or Controllers being released from the stage (turned off) using the controller [RELEASE] button. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Look Ahead Section: Set all controllers on will enable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Set all controllers off will disable the Look Ahead function for all controllers. Once all is set on, individual controllers may disable Look Ahead at any time. Once all off, individual controllers may be enabled Look Ahead at any time. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Timing Properties - Snap Section: Default fade time for all controllers being initiated by the Snap. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Timing Properties - Snap Section: Default fade time for all controllers being initiated by the Snap. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Timing Properties - System Time Section: System Time (Editor Time) is applied to values being introduced into the editor and other miscellaneous features that do not otherwise have their own timing settings. 7.3 Network Network Properties - Local Local: Set local console IP Console State: The unique name is assigned to the console to help identify it in the partners list.
