# Working With Time Code

Time code is used to synchronize Vibe events with the internal timeline or external SMPTE linear timecode (LTC) or MIDI timecode.

## Timecode and Timeline basics



Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. There is no practice limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show but graphic performance may suffer with more than 16 Timeline Tracks. Each timeline may have its own timecode source.

Vibe can read the following sources:

-   Virtual Local - Internally generated timecode.
    
-   Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI timecode received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console.
    
-   USB MIDI class compliant timecode.
    
-   MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol.
    
-   Input sources from remote multi-User consoles and devices
    

Unlike some consoles, Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. There is no need to create event lists. Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks.

Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source.

Supported frame rates are:

-   24 FPS
    
-   25 FPS
    
-   29.97 FPS drop-frame
    
-   30 FPS


## Create a Timeline View


When starting a new show any Timeline views stored in Layouts will be empty and no timecode devices will be connected to the Timeline View. If no layout contains a Timeline view, a view must be added to a blank page. Virtually unlimited timecode views may be created but they will all be synchronized and show the same tracks and options.

**Timeline view with two timeline tracks, the cursor, and a marker**

**To add a Timeline view to a page:**

1.  Tap {Vibe} on the monitor that will display the Timeline - Vibe menu will open.
    
2.  Tap {Pages} - Page display will open.
    
3.  Add a blank page from either the {Programming} or {Playback} work space templates - A blank workspace will open.
    
4.  Tap the Lock/Unlock icon to enable adding a new view.
    
5.  On the screen with the blank workspace, open the {Vibe} menu again and select} ‚ü∂ {Display Objects} ‚ü∂  {Timeline View} - A blank timeline view will appear on the workspace.
    
6.  Size and drag the Timeline view as required then tap {unlock/lock} icon to lock the Topo from further adjustment - The Timeline view is now ready to add tracks to.


## Configuring Timecode

Timecode connectors for the following:

-   Audio input Combi Jack with: 

    ‚óæ Female unbalanced line level input on 1/4" Phone jack 

    ‚óæ Female 3 pin XLR balanced line level input.
    
-   5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI and MIDI timecode input.
    

Additionally, the following general purpose ports may be used for Timecode:

-   USB 2 and USB 3 ports can be used for USB class compliant MIDI over USB.
    
-   Compulite devices that support MIDI over Ethernet can also be used.
    

Recommended quality and level for SMPTE:

-   SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended.
    
-   As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, If long runs are to be used, it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance.

**1/O Settings Pop-up in Timecode Tab**

**Enable Timecode:**

1.   From the patch toolbar tap {I/O Settings}
    
2.  For Tap {General} tab and select: 
   
    ‚óæ {Local MIDI} to enable the DIN connector MIDI. 
  
    ‚óæ {External MIDI} to enable USB MIDI or MIDI over Ethernet.
    
3.  Tap the {Timecode} tab, the Timecode pop-up will appear.
    
4.  Enable {MTC In} to enable any type of MIDI timecode input.
    
5.  Enable {SMPTE In} to receive LTC audio timecode. (Frames are automatically matched to the incoming frame rate}
    
6.   Currently, Vibe is only capable of being a timecode Slave but will be able to be the MIDI timecode Master in future releases.


## Recording Timeline Tracks

After a Timeline View has been created, timeline tracks may be recorded. Currently, timeline events are recorded in "real time" and then edited.

**To create a timeline track:**

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FAiiso4f15WODVxfvLcZf%2F21.4.webp?alt=media&token=6d042dc3-2c94-47b0-910d-e5481466fa85)

1.  Open a Time Line View.
    
2. Tap {[<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F2ksINLMhyiTpYXZCPpf9%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=81dd37e7-b60f-4d2d-9d59-a41d6c0ecf20" width="30"/>](image.png)} - The "Create New Timeline" pop-up will open.
    
3.  Select a timeline number and name.
    
4.  Choose Start from {Blank} Timeline as an option.
    
5.  Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source. 

    ‚óæ Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock. 

    ‚óæ Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console. 

    ‚óæ Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device.
    
6.  Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button.
    
    ![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2Fl4fNaYR34NAoNMJxt3HL%2F21.4.1.webp?alt=media&token=fb24e6fe-6798-432f-a7d7-b454cf666b76)
    
    ‚óæ Record overwrites existing events. 
    
    ‚óæ + Record adds events to existing events.
    
7. If using internal TC, press Play.
    
8.  If using external TC start the timecode source.
    
9.  The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controller's events.
    
10.  When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.
    
11.  üëâ <span style="color:Red">Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events.</span>




## Executing and Editing Events


To Execute timeline events:

-   If the source is external MIDI or SMPTE timecode, press [Play] on the timecode source. The events will synchronize to the source timecode.
    
-   If the source is internal, tap {Play} on the timecode view's control bar. The internal timecode will start and events will execute.
    
-   The control bar may be used to stop and rewind events when the source is internal Editing timecode events
    
-   Record may be enabled and disabled "on the fly" to overwrite sections of a timeline track.
    
-   Events may also be moved forwards and backward using the Set Delta pop-up in the Actions drop down.

## Markers


To aid in timeline navigation, Markers may be inserted.

To insert a marker:

-   Press the + at the desired location when the timeline is running. A marker will be inserted.
    
-   Press ‚üµ to move backwards through the markers.
    
-   Press ‚ü∂  to move forwards through the markers.
    
-   Press üóëÔ∏è to delete a marker
