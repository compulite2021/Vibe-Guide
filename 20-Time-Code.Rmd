# Timeline

Time code is used to synchronize Vibe events with the internal timeline or external SMPTE linear timecode (LTC) or MIDI timecode.

## Basics {#Basics-20.1.}


Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. There is no practice limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show but graphic performance may suffer with more than 16 Timeline Tracks. Each timeline may have its own timecode source.

Vibe can read the following sources:

-   Virtual Local - Internally generated timecode.
    
-   Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI timecode received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console.
    
-   USB MIDI class compliant timecode.
    
-   MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol.
    
-   Input sources from remote multi-User consoles and devices
    

Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks.

Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source.

Supported frame rates are:

-   24 FPS
    
-   25 FPS
    
-   29.97 FPS drop-frame
    
-   30 FPS


**Vibe has Timecode connectors for the following:**

-   Audio input Combi Jack with: 

    - Female unbalanced line level input on 1/4" Phone jack 

    - Female 3 pin XLR balanced line level input.
    
-   5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI and MIDI timecode input.
    

**Additionally, the following general purpose ports may be used for Timecode:**

-   USB 2 and USB 3 ports can be used for USB class compliant MIDI over USB.
    
-   Compulite devices that support MIDI over Ethernet can also be used.
    

**Recommended quality and level for SMPTE:**

-   SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended.
    
-   As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, If long runs are to be used, it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance.
    

## Configure Timecode {#Configure-Timecode-20.2.}

To trigger a timeline with a timecode source, the 
Open the {Vibe} menu and select: {Settings} ⟶ {I/O Settings} 

A popup will open, where the connections and protocols can be configured and enabled or disabled.

6.  <span style="color:Gray">Currently, Vibe is only capable of being a timecode Slave but will be able to be the MIDI timecode Master in future releases.</span>




## Timeline View {#Timeline-View-20.3.}


If no layout contains a Timeline view, the first step to create a Timeline is to add a Timeline View to the workspace layout. Unlimited timecode views may be created, but they will all be synchronized and show the same tracks and options.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FnGLpgXe9CBaHIDAeyvZq%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=86dd2f10-6d2a-4905-bfeb-baec212c85db)

**To add a Timeline view to a page:**

1.  Tap {Vibe} on the monitor that will display the Timeline - Vibe menu will open.
    
2.  Tap {Pages} - Page display will open.
    
3.  Add a blank page from either the {Programming} or {Playback} work space templates - A blank workspace will open.
    
4.  Tap the Lock/Unlock icon to enable adding a new view.
    
5.  Open the {Vibe} menu and select: {Program Views} ⟶ {Timeline View} 
    A blank timeline view will appear on the workspace.

6.  Size and drag the Timeline view as required then tap {unlock/lock} icon to lock the Topo from further adjustment - The Timeline view is now ready to add tracks to.



## Record a Timeline {#Record-a-Timeline-20.4.}

After a Timeline View has been created, timeline tracks may be recorded. Currently, timeline events are recorded in "real time" and then edited.

**To create a timeline track:**

4.  Choose Start from {Blank} or {Existing} Timeline and Apply.
    
5.  Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source. 

    - Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock. 

    - Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console. 

    - Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device.
    
6.  Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button.
    
    ![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2Fl4fNaYR34NAoNMJxt3HL%2F21.4.1.webp?alt=media&token=fb24e6fe-6798-432f-a7d7-b454cf666b76)
    
    - Record overwrites existing events. 
    
    - (+) Record adds events to existing events.
    
7. If using internal TC, press Play.
    
8.  If using external TC start the timecode source.
    
9.  The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controller's events.
    
10.  When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.
    
11.  👉 <span style="color:Red">Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events.</span>


**Timeline Features**

To trigger Timeline commands via the panel and Editor Toolbar there is an "Active Timeline View" indicator:

**Grid View Filters**

Switch from the Graphical to the Grid view with the left button on the control bar.

In the grid view it is possible to see all events from all timelines or to filter events by timeline and see only its own events.


![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F1GcF6cL317OyaygZLFZV%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=7b352b8c-dfaf-402d-a9fc-5e986b395212)



## Edit Timeline Events {#Edit-Timeline-Events-20.5.}


**Events Selection**

To Select timeline events:

- Tap on a single event – toggles the event selection

- Tap on a playback box – toggles the playback selection

- Tap on a marker – toggles the marker selection

- Rectangle draw using touch and drag – toggles all the events inside the rectangle

- Double-tap an empty area – clear the selection

- Double tap on the time bar – sets the current time to the selected time

- Long click an event and drag – moves the position of all the selected events

- Double finger vertical scroll on the view – will scroll the Timelines

- Double finger horizontal scroll on the time bar – will scroll the time bar

<span style="color:Red">**Important!**</span>

Selecting one object type (i.e. Playback, Event, Marker…) will clear all other objects selection. 

Selection can have only one type of objects at a time.



**Actions**

All the events can be moved on the timeline with drag&drop commands in the graphical view, or by assigning a different time in the grid bar.

The Actions menu allows to enable or disable the selected events, to delete them from the timeline, or to hide the disabled events from the view.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FfR30nB675vPr3V3MbmKF%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=068aeed6-708a-4203-a7b6-c626b451a4d8)

**Reset Slider Value**

Timelines record the slider values, but in the Actions menu there is the option to reset the value to from a playback and set it to a fixed value between zero and full.


**To clear the slider value from a timeline**

1. Open a timelines

2. Select the target playback

3. On the menu, open the Actions

4. Press Reset Slider

5. Assign the slider value on the virtual slider popup


**Move Selection**

It is possible to change selected event times via the physical wheels.

There are 2 new buttons to assign the delta time for the selected events to the physical wheel and then move it.

This option is available under the *Move Selection* sub-menu of the Timeline view (*Wheel On, Wheel Off*).

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F0PRTpcVpuXr0euSzyomY%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=5e0244e3-c571-48b0-b1c1-2d72b0778999)

Then there will be 2 physical wheels that are available for use:

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FZYiJxaCTcXmcfomXlZuM%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=f1407bc6-fecc-4f8c-9615-f8a7541966dd)

The left one is for moving the selected events.

The right one is to change the time resolution for the current time movement.


**Commands for Timelines**

These commands will affect the selected timelines in the sequence. Some sequences will affect the selected timelines regardless of their current view and some will affect them on the "Active Timeline View".

1. Go to idle state

2. Press Timeline # (+#, ⟶#, etc.)

3. You see on the Editor Toolbar the available commands:

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FzgT27J7izwv0ermWLplh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=8ebdbcb1-4cfc-4f5d-a4db-a219ef3f88d3)


4. **Sequence may also end with:**

	 **a.** Store – will create the timelines if they are not already created

	 **b.** Delete – will delete the timelines if they exist

	 **c.** Text – will open text box to give a name to the selected timelines

	 **d.** Copy – will add the timelines to the clipboard 
	 
	 **e.** Paste – 		 	will paste the copied timelines from the clipboard
	



## Execute Timeline Events {#Execute-Timeline-Events-20.6}

-   If the source is external MIDI or SMPTE timecode, press [Play] on the timecode source. The events will synchronize to the source timecode.
    
-   If the source is internal, tap {Play} on the timecode view's control bar. The internal timecode will start and events will execute.
    
-   The control bar may be used to stop and rewind events when the source is internal.

-   Record may be enabled and disabled "on the fly" to overwrite sections of a timeline track.
    
-   forwards and backward using the Set Delta pop-up in the Actions drop down.


**State Machine Support**

To trigger Timeline commands via the panel and Editor Toolbar there is an "Active Timeline View" indicator:

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FlKeiPK6tnS5KxOAvwPwp%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=87396a0f-bdd3-4e7c-aee1-65341332d0e3)


If there are more than 1 Timeline Views on the layout, only 1 of them can be the "Active" one.

Tapping the white header of the view will select the current view as the "Active" and will remove the Active sign from the other views.

<span style="color:Red">**Important!**</span>

Each Timeline View has an active clock. All Timeline Views that have the same clock will be automatically synced.

The available commands from the panel or the Editor Toolbar are split into 2 levels:


**Commands for the View**

These commands will affect the Active Timeline View.

1. Go to idle state

2. Press *Timeline* from the panel

3. You see on the Editor Toolbar the available commands:

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FWK0w3FLBG2M0FsJd9FEY%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=cdbedd39-d8ff-44a3-8f84-68a0ed7a2204)



## Markers {#Markers-20.7.}


To aid in timeline navigation, Markers may be inserted.


![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FSou2Iz4861ze8cyJBkg4%2F21.6.webp?alt=media&token=346cd8e4-e42b-492b-acf2-8dbb33e9ab00)
