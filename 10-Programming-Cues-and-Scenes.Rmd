## What Are Qlists, Cues, Scenes, and Submasters? {WhatAreQlists-Cues-Scenes-andSubmasters-10.1.}


**Qlists:**

-   Qlists are containers that hold cues. They might metaphorically be thought of as file folders.
    
-   Each Qlist has its own unique Cue numbering system.
    
-   Qlists currently may contain up to 8,000 cues.
    
-   Qlists containing Cues must be assigned to Controllers before they can be output to the stage.
    

**Cues:**

-   Cues are stored containers of editor values. They might metaphorically be thought of as files or records.
    
-   Cue may only exist within Qlists.
    
-   Cues may be numbered from 0.001 ⟶  999.999
    
-   Cues cannot be stored without a Qlist destination.
    
-   **Cues may be assigned:** 

	-   In Time 

	-    Out Time 

	-   Delay In Time 

	-   Delay Out Time 

	-   Text Label
    

**Scenes:**

-   Scenes are essentially a QList and a Cue combined.
    
-   Scenes may only contain a single "Look" of editor values.
    
-   **Scenes assigned to Slider Controllers are given the default settings of:** 

	-    {GO + Jump Parameters} 

	-   {Release At Bottom}
    
-   Scenes may only be assigned In-TIme.
    
-   Scenes may be given Text Labels

Submasters:
- A special type of Scene where stored fixtures **inhibit** their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller's value. All other parameter values are ignored.

- Groups may directly be assigned to controllers to create Group Submasters. **Group Submasters** reference the original Groups and update automatically if the Groups are modified.





## Tracking Principals {#TrackingPrincipals-10.2.}



Vibe uses the **Tracking/Move Fade** philosophy common in most current lighting consoles. In tracking consoles, "Hard Values" (parameter values with stored information) track forward from cue to cue until new hard values are encountered. 

**If we think of cues and values as a spreadsheet, basic tracking systems have two kinds of parameter value cells:**

-   "Hard Value" Cells
    
-   "Tracking Cells" get their values by "seeing above" to the original hard values. They are basically transparent and only hard values are stored for a Cue. This is more efficient.
    

**Storing Cue information on a cell basis has other advantages:**

-   Each parameter cell can have its own individual time which overrides overall cue time. This allows, for example, Pan/Tilt to have a separate transition time or Color Wheels to snap to their values instead of using overall cue time.
    
-   As Vibe's default behaviour for parameters it **LTP** (The last action takes precedent), a cell assigned its own time will continue to run its time until either the stored time runs out or it encounters a new hard value.

>Some traditional theatre consoles call "Hard Values" "Move Instructions" and cells that are in transition, "Move Fades".

-   Another advantage of tracking is that if you have values that are tracking through a number of cues, all you have to do is change the original hard values and that information will change down to the next hard value. You do not have to copy the change to each cue.
    

**An issue with tracking is that making a modification to values in one of the cues in the tracked range will change the values in all the cues following it. To solve this problem, Vibe offers two options:**

1.
    **Qonly**
    

-   **{Qonly}** - Used in any case where **cue modification, cue insertion, or cue deletion** must affect **"This Cue Only"**.
    
-   The look of the cue following any of the above operations will maintain the appearance it had before the operation. This is done by automatically copying the hard values that made up the original look (stage state) and pasting them into the cue following the modification. The downside is that there is no longer a tracking link from the original hard values even though the values match the original values.
    

2. **Skip Track**

-   **{Skip}** - Stores modified values as a special kind of cell that acts like a normal **Tracking Cell** until the **Skip Cell** is reached. The **Skip Cell** then behaves as if it has hard values and outputs its value to the stage. When the Qlist is advanced past a cue with the **Skip Cells**, they again behave as tracking cells, thus restoring the link to the original hard values.
    
-   Storing a Cue modification using **Skip**, has the same apparent result as storing **Qonly**. The main difference is that with **Qonly**, the link to the original hard values is lost, and with **Skip**, the link is preserved.
    
-   To make it easier for users to identify cues with **Skip** Cells, the parameter value with the **Skip** will be displayed in <span style="color:Magenta">Magenta</span>.

## Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers {#StoringCuesandScenesDirectlytoControllers-10.3.}


**Cues and Scenes may be stored:**

-   Directly to the Master Controller using command line syntax.
    
-   Directly to a specified Qlist and Cue using syntax.
    
-   Directly to a controller.
    

**To store the first cue directly to a controller:**

-   Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [HERE] (to **any** of the buttons of a controller). The first available Qlist will be assigned to the controller and Cue 1 will be created.
    
-   Alternately a Cue # may be specified in advance: [STORE] [CUE] [3] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of the destination controller).
    
-   A Qlist # may also be specified in advance: [STORE] [QLIST] [3] [CUE] [1] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of the destination controller).
    

**To append additional cues to a controller:**

-   Set parameter values in the Editor then press the [STORE] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of a controller that already has cues stored on it). A cue will be appended to the first available whole number of the Qlist
    

**To Store a Scene to a controller:**

-   Set parameter levels in the Editor then press [STORE] [SCENE] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of the destination controller). The first available Scene # will be assigned to the controller. No Qlist will be assigned.
    
-   Alternately a Scene # may be specified in advance. [STORE] [SCENE] [3] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of the destination controller).


**To convert a Scene to a Qlist:**

1. Press [STORE] [HERE] to an existing Scene.
    
2. The Store to Controller pop-up will appear. Tap {Create a new Qlist} the Scene will be assigned the first available Qlist with the Scene's look being converted to Cue 1.

## Master Controller {#MasterController-10.4.}


In Vibe, at least one controller must be assigned as the [SELECT] controller. This controller will now be linked to the Master Controller.

**The Master Controller has 4 large buttons associated with it:**

1.   [GO] - Initiates a forward timed fade between cues in the selected Qlist.
    
2.  [BACK] - Backs up one cue at a time using system timing properties' **Back Time**.
    
3.  [HOLD] - Pauses the progress of a fade
    
4.   [GOTO] - Advances to the specified cue in system timing properties' **GOTO Time**.
    


![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FBHxc5Q4Nsp0bSvXoqXgY%2F10.4.webp?alt=media&token=58f1929e-1d7d-4e60-b83f-94cc9678a3cc)

**Associated with but not limited to the controller assigned as the [SELECT] Controller are the following 3 buttons:**

1.   [Load] - Preloads a controller with a specified cue # but does not advance to the cue. Pressing [GO] will advance to the preloaded cue using cue time.
    
2.   [Release] - Releases the destination controller from affecting the stage (Turns it off).
    
3.  [Free] - Unloads the controller.

>[Load] [Release] and [Free] do not work with the big Master Controller buttons, only with any button on the controller that is associated with it as the [SELECT] controller.

By default cues that do not have a Qlist or Controller specified in their destination will be stored to the controller selected as the Master Controller.





## Storing Cues to the Master Controller {#StoringCuestotheMasterController-10.5.}

>A Qlist must be assigned to the [SELECT] controller before cues can be stored using theatre style keypad syntax

>A Qlist does not have to contain cues to be assigned to a controller

**To assign a Qlist to a controller and make it the Master Controller:**

1.  Press [QLIST] [#] [HERE] (press **any** of the buttons of the destination controller) - The Qlist will be assigned to the controller.
    
2.   Press [SELECT] [HERE] (press any of the buttons of the destination controller) - The destination controller will now be the Master Controller and the [Second Button] of the "Selected" controller will turn dark blue to indicate that it is now assigned to the Master Controller. The top header of the Controller Display on the main monitor above the controller will also turn <span style="color:Blue">dark blue</span>.
    

**To Store a cue to the Master Controller:**

1.  Set Parameter levels in the Editor the press [CUE] [#] [STORE]. The cue will be added to the Master Controller's assigned Qlist.
    
2.  Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001 → 999.999
    
3.  Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax or the Direct Store method.
    
4.   Pressing [STORE] [STORE] or [STORE] [ENTER] will store editor values to the next whole number cue at the end of a Qlist. (Next spacing can be customized in system settings).

>Vibe uses the "Clear Editor After Store" behaviour common in most theatre consoles.
<span style="color:Red">The Controller will by default advance to the stored cue and clear the Editor</span>. This behaviour may be disabled in System Settings.






## Storing Qlist Cues to any Controller {#StoringQlistCuestoanyController-10.6.}

><span style="color:Red">The destination Qlist must be assigned to a controller in advance or after storing the first Cue, the destination Qlist will bump the current cue on the Master Controller out and replace it.</span>.

**To store a Cue to a Qlist that is already assigned to a Controller:** (Usually not the Master Controller)

1.   Press [Qlist] [#] [HERE] to any button of the destination controller. The Qlist will be assigned to the controller
    
2.  Set parameter levels in the Editor
    
3. Press [Qlist] [#] [CUE] [#] [STORE]
    
4.  Valid Cue numbers per Qlist = 000.001 → 999.999
    
5. Addition cues may be stored via keypad syntax specifying the Qlist # in advance or [10.3. Storing Cues and Scenes Directly to Controllers](#StoringCuesandScenesDirectlytoControllers-10.3.)​




## Cue Store Options {#CueStoreOptions-10.7.}

In the process of storing a cue, a number of filters and settings are available. 

**To open the Store Options pop-up, two methods are available:**

-   **Store cues using keypad syntax:**
    

1.   Set values in the Editor.
    
2.   [CUE] [#] [OPTIONS] Cue Store Options pop-up opens. Make selections and press [STORE].
    

-   **Store directly to a Qlist on a Controller:**
    

1.  Set Values in the Editor.
    
2.  Press [STORE] [OPTIONS] **Cue Options** pop-up opens. Make selections and press [HERE] to any button on the destination controller.
    

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FknletXzqZk4W9tZ8qBWq%2F10.7%20cue%20store%20options.png?alt=media&token=d07a452b-3958-4a12-a42a-abad08bdaa5c)
<p align=center> Cue Store Options Pop-up </p>

**Options are:**

-   Editor as Source: 
	- {Red + Grey} Editor Values in <mark style="color:white;background-color:red;" >100%</mark> <mark style="color:black;background-color:LightGray;" >90%</mark> will be stored. 
	- {Store Stage} All fixtures outputting ANY DMX from the console will be stored. This includes tracked values, home values and dimmer values at zero. 
	- {Red Only} Only Editor values in <mark style="color:white;background-color:red;" >Red</mark> will be stored. This can be a useful way to filter parameters. 
	- {All Param For Selected} All parameters from the fixture selection will be turned red and stored in the cue. 
	- {All Param If Active} All parameters of all fixtures in the editor will be stored if the dimmer parameter is greater than zero (WYSIWYG).
    

-   Additional: 
	-  <span style="color:Gray">{DMX In} Takes a snapshot of incoming DMX and attaches it to the cue. </span>
	- {Force Black} When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first "forced" to Black Out, parameters they move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time.
    

-   Filtering: 
	- {Show Filters} Opens user prebuilt filters in the pop-up.
    

-   Source behaviour when stored: 
	- {Track} Normal system behaviour 
	- {Skip Cue} - <span style="color:Gray">Tags a cue as a skip cue in the case of inserting a new cue. In the case of updating a cue by storing to an existing cue, only the values being updated will be made into Skip cells. </span>.
	- <span style="color:MediumAquaMarine">{Qonly} Inserted cues will not affect the look of cues following them</span>
    

-   Look Ahead: (sometimes referred to as Mark Cue) [See: 15.3. Force Black](#ForceBlack-15.3.) 

	- Unlike having to Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in **Cue Store Options** as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just the tagged cue.
    

-   Force Black - See: [15.1. Look Ahead (Move in Dark)](#LookAhead-15.1.) 

	-  Tagged a cue as {Force Black} in Cue Store Options, is the same as setting the cue as {Force Black} in {Cue settings}.






## Assigning Text Labels {#AssigningTextLabels-10.8.}

**Assign a Text Label to a Qlist:**

-   Method 1 - [QLIST] [#] [TEXT] opens the Text Entry pop-up.
    
-   Method 2 - [QLIST [#] [SETTINGS] opens the Qlist Properties tab or Qlist popup.
    
-   Method 3 - Press the Qlist header above a loaded Controller, The Qlist Properties pop-up opens - Enter Qlist Text in the white box.

## Modifying Cues and Scenes {#ModifyingCuesandScenes-10.9.}

**Modify a Cue or Scene using [UPDATE]:**

1.  Make a change to parameter values already outputting to the stage from an **active** cue or scene.
    
2.  Press the [UPDATE] and the **Update pop-up** will open. Two columns will appear. The left column shows **Cues** available for updating and the right column shows **Libraries** available for updating. If affected values are not referencing a library, the Cue column will indicate the **source** cue that the modifications will be updated to.
    
3.  If the Editor parameter values are **new** to all active cues, destination cue. Will be dependent on the **New Values** setting: 


- If {All Selected Objects} is selected, a list of all possible active cues will appear in the Cue column. 

- If {Master <span style="color:MediumAquaMarine">PB</span> Only} (controller) is selected, new values will be only be updated to the Qlist assigned as Master Controller. 

- If {Don't Store} is selected, no new parameter values will be updated.
    

4. Selected cues may be freely deselected in the Update pop-up.

5. Set **Tracking Options** as required.

6. Set **Source Filters** as required.

7. Press [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png) or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up and complete the Update.

**UPDATE Tracking Options:**

-   {Default (Track)} - Changes will track forward to the next cue if it does not have a hard value.
    
-   {Cue Only} - Changes will be made to "This Cue Only" preserving the look of the next cue (Hard values will be added to next cue).
    
-   {Skip <span style="color:MediumAquaMarine">Cue</span>} - Changes will be made to the current cue but the changes will be "skipped over" preserving the link to the original hard values.
    
-   {Back Track} - Updates the changes to the **original** hard value that made the stage look.
    

**Update directly to a Controller:**

1.   Make a change to parameter value outputting to the stage.

### Loop {#loop-10.12.2.}

In many consoles, the only way to create a loop is to create a link from the end of a range of cues back to the beginning. Follow time must then be assigned to all of the cues. In Vibe this is also possible but a shorter more efficient method is also provided. **LOOP** is a function similar to **LINK**. It is assigned in the Loop pop-up or via the Cue Settings pop-up.

### Tracking Options {#tracking-options-10.12.3.}



**Individual cues may be tagged with one of four Tracking Options:**

1.  Cue Only - Removes tracked values from asserting to the stage and sets them at home values (Not to be confused with Cue Only when used with **{UPDATE}** which works a cell basis).
    
2.  Skip Cue - All cells in the cue will behave like Skip Cells. Values will still "skip around" a Skip Cue, even if the values in the Skip Cue are modified.
    
3.  Block Cue - All cue parameter values whether tracked or hard will be made to act like hard values. Any new values added to cues above the Blocked cue will not track past a cue tagged a Block.
    
4.  Track - The systems default behaviour.
    

**There are two additional properties a cue can be tagged with:**

1.  Force Black - When it is not desirable to see values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programming time. In a cue tagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first "forced" to Black Out, parameters then move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time.
    
2. <span style="color:Gray">Look Ahead cue - When Look Ahead is disabled for a Qlist, Individual cues with dark values may be tagged to perform Look Ahead pre-positioning.</span>

>In live playback view, cues that are set as Block Cues have a blue color.
In live playback view, cues that are set as Skip Cues have a magenta color.

## Parameter Profile {#ParameterProfile-10.14.}

Profile determine a parameter's behavior during a fade.
Profiles are always relative to the fade time.
Profile options are available in a popup that is triggered from a button on the toolbar named Profile. This button is valid once there is a valid parameter selection.

Profile examples:
- Linear (default) – on go, the parameter fades in cue time to its new level
- Jump on Start (One) – on go, the parameter jumps to its level
- Jump on End – when the fade is complete, the parameter jumps to its new level
- Jump on 50% (Step) – when the fade reaches 50% of the cue time, the parameter jumps to its new level
Any function from the system functions can be applied as a profile.

**To Set a Parameter Profile**
1. Select fixtures
2. Select parameter(s)
