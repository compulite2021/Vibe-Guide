## Introduction {#Introduction-4.1}

Vibe uses a Multi-touch based interface with simple familiar gestures for navigation.

-   Supported gestures:

    ◾ Two fingers for swipe and scrolling.
    
    ◾ One finger select. 
    
    ◾ Multi-selection via ️️⤴ ⤵ shaped gestures.
    
    ◾ <span style="color:Gray">Multi-selection via window.</span>
    

-   Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added using DisplayPort 1.2 or higher MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). The large 21" embedded screen is general-purpose like the external monitors.
    

-   The smaller 11.6" **Smart Screen** is dedicated to displaying context sensitive interactive parameter information such as color pickers and gobo pickers.
    

-   Each monitor, (excluding the **Smart Screen**) can contain one Window Frame.
    

-   Window frames can contain one of three **Workspace Templates**.
    

-   Each Template has a dedicated display in the lower area. This area will have different fixed options and information depending on the selected Workspace Template.
    

-   The remainder of the template may be freely customized by the user.
    

-   Each Template can contain up to 4 **Pages** that can be toggling using the **WorkSpace**  **Template**  **Keys** or by tapping the yellow **{VIBE}** Menu key at the bottom left of each Workspace Template and tapping the **{PAGES}** key to the right of the **{VIBE}** key to open the page's display.
    

-   Each Monitor (excluding the **Smart Screen**) can contain its own independent set of **WorkSpace**  **Templates**.
    

-   Workspace Templates are organized into three familiar categories, each with a dedicated display key. These keys are found above the top left corner of the **Smart Screen**: 

    - **[PATCH]**
	
    - **[PROG]** - (Program) 
	
    - **[PLAY-B]** - (Playback Controllers)
    

-   The Workspace Template Keys are specific to the monitor that has focus (last touched or selected via a mouse).
    


## VIBE Menu {#VIBE-Menu-4.2}


The **{VIBE}** Menu is a hierarchical menu containing logically grouped sub-menus. It is used to access common system functions such as **Save** and **System Settings** as well as configure **Workspace Template** displays.

Vibe Menu can be opened at any time by tapping on the Vibe key in the low left corner of the screen.

-   **The Patch Template** 

-   **The Program Template** 

-   **The Playback Template** 

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FfYgdOdvm8QjxtpB31GPk%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=a2f4234b-2008-4931-94c4-d5d7e29e2937)


The Page screen can be accesses by tapping Vibe Menu and then Pages on the toolbar, or by pressing the VIEW button.

All the Page types can be composed with any view, independently from where the view is located in the Vibe Menu.
The pages can also be switched from one type to another, as soon as one of the 4 spaces per type is available.

On the Console it is recommended to set views such as the System Status and the Playback Status on the bottom of the Program and Playback pages, to have them in correspondence to the physical controllers.


**Home Pages**

Layout home page buttons are a fast recall for up to three main pages.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FQky1ma4eRNeqE5jGk280%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=42e0dc5d-20f9-481c-baa3-768dcc0142a8)

Any page can be stored as a Home Page on the Editor Toolbar, near the VIBE menu button.



**To set up home pages**

1. Open the Vibe menu and press Pages button on the editor toolbar

2. Enable Selection in the Pages view

3. Select a Page and assign it as a Home Page on the Toolbar

## WorkSpaces{#WorkSpaces-4.4}


### Basics

-   When configuring workspaces, any object at the end of the hierarchical sub-menu can be tapped to open its object on a blank portion of the current workspace or dragged and dropped to the workspace surface. Once on the surface it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting.
    

-   If an object is dragged on top of another both will turn green and become one **tabbed** object.
    

-   To edit the placement of objects, the **{Lock}** icon beside the **{VIBE}** menu key  must be toggled to unlock the workspace display. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the display and allow normal usage.
    

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FRgauawhpMT9fs8UyREov%2F4.2.1.webp?alt=media&token=9ba0114d-9b28-4942-b8cc-835d775dae8b)

Some of the views have their own settings that can be accessed when layout is in edit mode, the view is selected and tapping the {Settings} button on the toolbar.

### Toggle Scrollbar

The Toggle Scrollbar button, in the scrollable views’ settings, adds or removes a scrollbar to/from the view.

### Toggle Frame

The Toggle Frame button adds or removes the frame to/from the view.


### Frame Color

Frames colors can be customized for a better graphical separation between the views.


### Softkey Settings

Any softkey view can be graphically customized by selecting it in layout edit mode and opening the settings popup with the {Settings} button on the toolbar.

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2FTsArpvt37X2Hqhoy9XuB%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=86155389-1dcd-489e-b94d-6f18e449be0d)

Softkey settings are used to change the size, font and color of the softkeys’ text and background.

The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other views of the same tab, page, or to the softkey views in all the pages.

The settings can also be saved as default, and it’s always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes.

Some special color options are available to show color library softkeys with the softkey color either with the color or the colors that are stored in the library.

The icon in the view's header can be clicked to quickly jump to the top of the scrollable softkey views.

Specific settings, such as color and text size, can be assigned to each single button.

The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other single buttons of the same tab, page, or to the buttons in all the pages.

The settings can also be saved as default, and it’s always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes.



### Hide Menu
The Close Menu button is an option to hide menus in menuable views, such as Topo, Live, Created fixtures, Timeline, etc.

## Live Parameter Display {#live-parameter-display-4.9}


The Live Parameter Display shows values in a table format instead of spreadsheet format. 

**There are three Live Parameter Modes:** 
		
  - Live Parameters
    
  - Live Banks 
    
  - Live Fixtures

Live Parameter Mode is mainly used to display single parameter fixtures similar to theatrical consoles but is far more versatile.

### Parameter Mode

Unlike most theatrical consoles, parameters other than dimmer may be shown in Live Parameter Mode.

### Bank Mode

Fixtures may also be graphically displayed by banks.

**Currently, three banks can be graphically viewed**: <span style="color:Gray">Image will be implemented soon.</span>

-   **Intensity** - In the form of an illuminated disk.
    
-   **Position** - In the form of a cursor that moves in a black rectangle representing the stage.
    
-   **Color** - In the form of a circular color swatch - Color wheels are not currently supported.
