# Timeline 

This chapter deals with playback automation by creating Timelines and receiving external Time Code protocols and MIDI signals to trigger the controllers.

**The following is covered in this chapter:**

-  [14.1 Timelines](#Timelines-14.1)
-  [14.2 Time Code](#Time-Code-14.2)
-  [14.3 MIDI](#MIDI-14.3)


## Timelines {#Timelines-14.1}


Vibe uses a philosophy of Timeline Tracks. 

There is no limit to the number of Timeline Tracks that may be recorded in a show. 

Timelines can be added to a Timeline View and played simultaneously following an internal or external Time Code.

**Vibe can read the following Time Code sources**:

-   Virtual Local - Internally generated Time Code.
    
-   Physical Local - SMPTE or MIDI Time Code received at the SMPTE audio input or via the DIN 5 pin MIDI connector on the back of the console.
    
-   USB MIDI class compliant Time Code.
    
-   MIDI over Ethernet via Compulite VC protocol.
    
-   Input sources from remote Multi-User consoles and devices
    
Vibe can record data from multiple controllers simultaneously. 

Additional timeline subtracks will be created on a per controller basis. 

Vibe also supports fader automation on timeline tracks.

<p align=center> ![14.1-TL-Recorded](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FyNOEZfLp8MiQtJSklmZ3%2F14.1-TL-Recorded.webp?alt=media&token=7985f2a7-5a46-4d2e-b1c2-f55e3fd4059f) </p>

Vibe automatically matches frame rates to the incoming source.

Supported frame rates are:

-   24 FPS

-   25 FPS

-   29.97 FPS drop-frame

-   30 FPS

### View

If no layout contains a Timeline view, the first step to create a Timeline is to add a Timeline View to the layout.

Unlimited Timeline views may be created and each Timeline View may have its own **Time Code**.

As long as more Timeline views are set on different clock sources, they can load different Timelines and moved independently.

If Timeline views are based on the same clock source, they will be synchronized and will load the same tracks and options.

<p align=center> ![14.1-TL-View](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FOh7gGt5br6lurFzsNdes%2F14.1-TL-View.webp?alt=media&token=d7eb125f-df73-4bc3-9126-0e860424f46a) </p>

The Timeline view shows all the active Timelines and allows to enable and disable them, or play in "solo" mode.

Use the Timeline view's menu to load the Timelines on the view, as well as to create, edit or delete Timelines.

### Record

After a Timeline View has been created, timeline tracks may be recorded. 
Timeline events may be recorded in "real time" and then edited afterwards.

**Create a timeline track:**

<p align=center> ![14.1-Create-Timeline](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FoNmp9u7TitOInt5iiRuA%2F14.1-Create-Timeline.webp?alt=media&token=b5395505-25d3-43c0-bd94-cce6a48cf8eb) </p>

1.  Open the Timeline View menu.
    
2.  Tap + and the "Create New Timeline" popup will open.
    
3.  Select a timeline number and name.
    
4.  Choose Start from {Blank} or {Existing} Timeline and Apply.
    
5.  Tap the {Select Clock} drop down in the top left corner and select the timecode source. 

  - Virtual Local - Use internal timecode clock. 

  - Physical Local - Use the SMPTE or MTC timecode inputs on the console. 

  - Additional options will populate the list depending on the interfaced timecode device.
    
6.  Enable the red {Record} button or the {+ Record} button.
    
<p align=center> ![14.1-TL-Transport-Bar](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FGYHhuOgYXG6ubGBALCOi%2F14.1-TL-Transport-Bar.webp?alt=media&token=69968ead-6581-4b19-821a-3e6cd3992072) </p>

  - {Record} overwrites the existing events. 
  
  - {+ Record} adds new events to the existing ones.
    
7.  If using internal TC, press Play.
    
8.  If using external TC start the timecode source.
    
9.  The timeline will start to move and all controller presses and motorized fader moves will now be recorded on sub-tracks, one for each controller's events.
    
10.  When all recording is done, either stop the external timecode source or press the Stop button if the clock source is internal.
    
11.  üëâ <span style="color:Red">Disable the Record button to prevent accidental overwrite of events.</span>

**Trigger a Timeline**

Timelines can be triggered and zoomed via the Timeline view's transport bar.

Timeline commands can be also triggered via the Editor Toolbar in Program and Playback pages.

**Grid View Filters**

Switch from the Graphical to the Grid view and viceversa with the toggle button on the control bar.

In the grid view it is possible to see all events from all timelines or to filter events by timeline and see only its own events.

<p align=center> ![14.1-TL-Grid-View](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FFgICJWgLaaX6zER5xarw%2F14.1-TL-Grid-View.webp?alt=media&token=f3f48320-4168-415b-b8b7-51364667e4fd) </p>

## Time Code {#Time-Code-14.2}


Time Code is used to synchronize Vibe events with the internal timeline or external SMPTE Linear Time Code (LTC) or MIDI Time Code (MTC).

### Connections

Vibe has Time Code connectors for the following:

- Audio Combi Jack connector for SMPTE input with: 

  - Female unbalanced line level input on 1/4" phone jack 

  - Female 3 pin XLR balanced line level input.
    
- Female 5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI input.

- Female 5 Pin DIN connector for MIDI output.

- USB 2 and USB 3 ports for USB class compliant MIDI over USB devices.
    
- RJ45 ports for MIDI over Ethernet (Compulite devices)

### LTC

To trigger a timeline with an **LTC** or **Linear Time Code** source, the SMPTE input protocol needs to be enabled.

Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button.

The SMPTE Tab contains the toggle button to enable or disable the LTC input.

<p align=center> ![14.2-IO-Settings-SMPTE](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2Fg4bDJOgnX88CaU1CqrnZ%2F14.2-IO-Settings-SMPTE.webp?alt=media&token=2cadb1ad-2382-4443-89cc-1c5d971dfb75) </p>

<span style="color:Gray">Currently Vibe is only capable of receiving LTC inputs, but will be able to send SMPTE output in future releases.</span>

**Recommended quality and level for SMPTE:**

- SMPTE is very sensitive to distortion and also requires adequate gain. A clean audio signal with a gain ranging between 0db to +5db is recommended.
    
- As the console SMPTE input is high impedance, if long runs are to be used it is recommended to send a 150 - 600 ohm balancing line level feed to a transformer close to the console and convert to high impedance.

### MTC

To trigger a timeline with an **MTC** or **Midi Time Code** source, the MTC input protocol needs to be enabled.

Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button.

The MIDI Tab contains the toggle button to enable or disable the MTC input.

<p align=center> ![14.2-IO-Settings-MTC](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FC7IvLw0Gqs94XcmfKDVa%2F14.2-IO-Settings-MTC.webp?alt=media&token=75cc712a-9336-4d0e-bef4-57683b1502c2) </p>

<span style="color:Gray">Currently Vibe is only capable of receiving MTC inputs, but will be able to send MTC output in future releases.</span>

**MIDI Time Code** is similar to the SMPTE Time Code and is used to synchronize audio, video, and lighting equipment, but unlike the SMPTE it does not use an audio signal.
    
MTC is available in the following frame rates: 

  - 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work) 

  - 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video) 

  - 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video) 

  - 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video)


## MIDI {#MIDI-14.3}


MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that was originally developed by the music industry to allow multiple MIDI sound devices to be triggered from just one source, usually a master keyboard or synthesizer. 

MIDI is a control protocol and does not transmit audio. 

Over the years the MIDI protocol has evolved to become a common way to synchronize sound, video and lighting equipment. 

MIDI is based on a 7-bit architecture and therefore has a theoretical limit of 127 possible notes for a keyboard. (Most pianos use only 88 notes and synthesizers even less)

**MIDI implementation:**

-   16 independent MIDI channels - The channels systems listen to.
    
-   127 Note ONs - Pressing down on a keyboard.
    
-   127 Note OFFs - Lifting off a keyboard.
    
-   Note On Velocity of 1 ‚ü∂ 127 - How hard the key is struck.
    
-   After Touch pressure of 0 ‚ü∂ 127 - How much pressure is applied after the key reaches the bottom.
    
-   127 controllers each with a range of 0 ‚ü∂ 127 - Encoder wheels or sliders.
    
-   Patch changes from 0 ‚ü∂ 127 - Change from one instrument to another.
    
-   Pitch bend wheel that has a 14-bit resolution.
    
-   A section for MIDI time code and other manufacturer's "System Exclusive" information. 

### MIDI Settings

To receive and generate Midi signals each protocol needs to be enabled.

Open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button.

In MIDI Tab it is possible to enable and disable the Midi Notes, the Midi Time Code and the Midi Show Control devices.

**Configure MIDI:**

1.  Connect all appropriate MIDI devices and power them on.
    
2.  Toggle a MIDI Connection source:

   - **Local MIDI** is generated and received from the 5 pin DIN connectors on the back of the console.

   - **MIDI over USB** is transmitted and received over standard USB connectors. The device must be MIDI over USB class compliant to work with Windows without a driver. If the device has a Windows driver available it is recommended to install the driver for optimal results.

   -  **MIDI over Ethernet** is supported by Windows class compliant MIDI over Ethernet and Compulite VC MIDI over Ethernet devices.
   
   - **Refresh MIDI Connection** looks for new connections if devices have been added later.
    
3.  Press Apply to stay in I/O settings, press \[ENTER] or tap the Apply icon to close the popup.

### MIDI Notes

In lighting MIDI notes and controllers from external sources are matched to the console's controllers, buttons and wheels to synchronize the playback.

> A GO Button on console A is configured to send Note #46, and a GO button on console B is configured to receive note #46. Pressing GO on console A console will press the GO on console B. In EDM shows DJ's frequently control lighting via MIDI touchpad controllers.

To configure **MIDI Notes** open the I/O Settings popup from the Vibe menu or with the {I/O Settings} button.

In Midi Tab enable the Midi Notes In / Out and the Active Midi Channels on the columns.

In Notes/Commands Tab it is possible to assign specific commands to the Midi notes.

-   The numbers 0 ‚ü∂  127 on the MIDI grid represent 10 3/4 octaves of notes from C-0 ‚ü∂ G-10.
    
-   Tabs at the bottom filter the type of MIDI message to be received.
    
-   Channel # may also be selected to filter just messages being received on the selected channel.
    
The MIDI grid is used to select any of the 127 values available for the MIDI message types selected with the tabs.

### MSC

**MIDI Show Control** is a significant Real Time System Exclusive extension of the international Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. 

MSC enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control.

The MIDI Show Control protocol is an industry standard ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in 1991 which allows all types of entertainment control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications. 

Just like musical MIDI, MSC does not transmit the actual show media, it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance. * Courtesy Wikipedia
    
Midi Show Control was developed as a simple standard method of triggering basic commands on dissimilar devices. 

Basic MSC commands are:

-   Go

-   Stop

-   Fire (Generally used for macros)

Also supported on receive are:

-   All fixtures

-   General lights

-   Moving lights
