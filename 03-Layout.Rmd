This chapter provides an overview of Vibe's layout and GUI (Graphical User Interface).

**The following is covered in this chapter:**

-  [3.1 Interface](#Interface-3.1)
-  [3.2 Vibe Menu](#Vibe-Menu-3.2)
-  [3.3 Pages](#Pages-3.3)
-  [3.4 Views](#Views-3.4)
-  [3.5 Layouts](#Layouts-3.5)


## Interface {#Interface-3.1}


Vibe has a multi-touch based interface, using simple gestures for selection and navigation.

- Supported **Gestures**:

  ◾ One finger or left mouse click to select. 
  
  ◾ Two fingers or right mouse click to swipe and scroll.
  
  ◾ Long one finger press or left mouse click for drag&drop.
  
  ◾ Multi-selection via ️️⤴ ⤵ (right->up /right->down) shaped gestures.
  

- Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added by using Display Port 1.2 or higher and MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). 
    
- The large embedded screen called **Vibe Main Screen** is general-purpose, as well as the external monitors.

- The small embedded screen called **Smart Screen** is dedicated to context sensitive fixture information and interactive parameter pickers, used for Editor programming.

- Each screen, excluding the Smart Screen, can have one **Window** with an independent set of **Pages**.

- Each window can contain up to 12 Pages divided in 3 different Page Types:
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PATCH**
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PROGRAM**
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PLAYBACK**

- The page buttons, used to switch between the different pages, are specific to the monitor that has focus (the last touched or mouse selected screen).

### Smart Screen

The 11.6" multi-touch monitor embedded on the right Editor section of the Vibe console is referred to as the **Smart Screen**. 

<p align=center>**Smart Screen**</p>
`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.1-Smart-Screen")`

- On Vibe multi-screen console models the Smart Screen position is fixed on the dedicated monitor. The Smart Screen View cannot be moved on the other screens and the configuration of this screen cannot be customized.

- On Vibe single-screen console models and on Vibe PC the Smart Screen is a View, so it can be positioned on any layout Page.

### Toolbars

The left side of the Toolbar contains the **Vibe Menu** button, the **Home Pages** buttons, and the **Command Line** that shows the current syntax.

The right side of the Toolbar, also referred to as the **Editor Toolbar**, contains a set of interactive buttons that are used to access less common commands.

The **Editor Toolbar** shows a different set of buttons according to the programming syntax.

<p align=center>**Patch Toolbar**</p>
`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.1-Patch-Toolbar")`

<p align=center>**Program Toolbar**</p>
`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.1-Program-Toolbar")`

The functions of the Toolbar buttons are described in the following chapters.

- Pages can also be moved from one type to another, as soon as one of the 4 spaces per type is available.

- The Pages View can be unlocked through the Selection button in order to assign Home Pages, reorder the pages with drag and drop, Clone or Delete existent Pages.

👉 On the Console it is recommended to set views such as the System Status and the Playback Status on the bottom of the Program and Playback pages, to have them in correspondence to the physical controllers.

### Home Pages

Home page buttons, located on the Taskbar, are a fast way to recall up to three main pages.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.3-Home-Pages")`

Any page can be stored as a Home Page on the Page View.

F1 keyboard button switches between the three Home Pages.

The Clone Pages key is displayed on the Toolbar, near the menu, when the window is in View mode and it is unlocked by tapping the Selection key.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.3-Pages-Toolbar")`


## Views {#Views-3.4}


- Vibe Views are listed inside the Vibe Menu, into the Patch, Program, Playback Views sub-menus.

- Any View can be added to any Page and stored in the layout.

- Views can be resized and tabbed together, but each view has its own dimension limits.

- To edit the placement of views on the layout, the **{Lock}** icon near the **{VIBE}** menu key must be toggled to unlock the layout editing. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the layout and allow normal usage.

- To configure the layout, any object in the Patch, Program and Playback Views hierarchical sub-menus can be tapped to open the view on a blank portion of the current page, or can be dragged and dropped into the page surface. Once on the page it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. This operation automatically unlocks the layout editing.

- If an object is dragged on top of another, both will turn green showing it is possible to tab them and create a **tabbed** view. Keep a tabbed view pressed to extract an object from the tab an move it separately.

View settings can be accessed when layout is **Unlocked**, by selecting the view and tapping the buttons on the toolbar. These settings are applied to the selected view.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.4-Unlock-Layout")`

**Toggle Scrollbar**: add or remove a scrollbar to/from the view, if available.

**Toggle Frame**: add or remove the frame to/from the view.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.4-SK-Settings")`

Softkey settings are used to change the size, font and color of the softkeys’ text and background.

The settings can be saved as Pre-Built and applied to the other views of the same tab, page, or to the softkey views in all the pages.

The settings can be saved as default, and it is always possible to come back to the default or to reset the changes.

Some special color options are available to show color library softkeys with the colors that are stored in the library.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.4-SK-sample")`

The auto text color option in Softkey Settings popup automatically sets the softkey’s text color in black or white in contrast with the softkey’s background color, to make it always visible.

## Layouts {#Layouts-3.5}


- After all pages and views are configured, the layout configuration can be saved into a **Layout** file by tapping the **{VIBE}** Menu and then the **{LAYOUT}** key.

- After configuring new windows on the external monitors, a layout file should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layout files store the configuration of external monitors and if the system is booted without the expected external monitor a warning message will appear.

- Layout files, containing all the graphical settings of pages and views, are loaded independently from the Show files, containing all the stored data. 

👉 Layout Files are particularly useful when the same desk is managed by different operators; each user can load his own customized layout without losing any show data programmed by the previous user.

### Layout Settings

Layout Settings can be accessed when layout is **Locked**, by tapping the Vibe Menu and then the {Setting} button on the toolbar, near the Lock and Pages buttons. These settings are applied as defaults to all the Pages and Views.

`r create_image_tag("03.Layout", "3.5-Layout-Settings")`

It is possible to change the Vibe Theme, to move the Toolbar on top or bottom position on all the pages, and to set Default View Settings for the Headers, the Frames and the Scrollbars.
