## Interface {#Interface-3.1}


Vibe has a multi-touch based interface, using simple gestures for selection and navigation.

- Supported **Gestures**:

  ◾ One finger or left mouse click to select. 
  
  ◾ Two fingers or right mouse click to swipe and scroll.
  
  ◾ Long one finger press or left mouse click for drag&drop.
  
  ◾ Multi-selection via ️️⤴ ⤵ (right->up /right->down) shaped gestures.
  

- Vibe directly supports up to 4 monitors, two embedded and two external. (Additional monitors may be added by using Display Port 1.2 or higher and MST splitter for a total of 4 external monitors at 1920 x 1080 resolution). 
    
- The large embedded screen called **Vibe Main Screen** is general-purpose, as well as the external monitors.

- The small embedded screen called **Smart Screen** is dedicated to context sensitive fixture information and interactive parameter pickers, used for Editor programming.

- Each screen, excluding the Smart Screen, can have one **Window** with an independent set of **Pages**.

- Each window can contain up to 12 Pages divided in 3 different Page Types:
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PATCH**
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PROGRAM**
  
  - up to 4 Pages for **PLAYBACK**

- The page buttons, used to switch between the different pages, are specific to the monitor that has focus (the last touched or mouse selected screen).

### Smart Screen

The 11.6" multi-touch monitor embedded on the right Editor section of the Vibe console is referred to as the **Smart Screen**. 

<p align=center>**Smart Screen**</p>
<p align=center> ![3.1-Smart-Screen](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FIYKzE7HIxqtnUR28Neae%2F3.1-Smart-Screen.webp?alt=media&token=c6dcddeb-ec22-486f-aa1c-38f075ddeae1) </p>

- On Vibe multi-screen console models the Smart Screen position is fixed on the dedicated monitor. The Smart Screen View cannot be moved on the other screens and the configuration of this screen cannot be customized.

- On Vibe single-screen console models and on Vibe PC the Smart Screen is a View, so it can be positioned on any layout Page.

### Toolbars

The left side of the Toolbar contains the **Vibe Menu** button, the **Home Pages** buttons, and the **Command Line** that shows the current syntax.

The right side of the Toolbar, also referred to as the **Editor Toolbar**, contains a set of interactive buttons that are used to access less common commands.

The **Editor Toolbar** shows a different set of buttons according to the programming syntax.

<p align=center>**Patch Toolbar**</p>

### Home Pages

Home page buttons, located on the Taskbar, are a fast way to recall up to three main pages.

<p align=center> ![3.3-Home-Pages](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FGfujKT441ne2mId2JY4X%2F3.3-Home-Pages.webp?alt=media&token=559dadf5-a305-43d6-90b7-becae303704f) </p>

## Views {#Views-3.4}


- Vibe Views are listed inside the Vibe Menu, into the Patch, Program, Playback Views sub-menus.

- Any View can be added to any Page and stored in the layout.

- Views can be resized and tabbed together, but each view has its own dimension limits.

- To edit the placement of views on the layout, the **{Lock}** icon near the **{VIBE}** menu key must be toggled to unlock the layout editing. After changes are made, it must be toggled again to lock the layout and allow normal usage.

- To configure the layout, any object in the Patch, Program and Playback Views hierarchical sub-menus can be tapped to open the view on a blank portion of the current page, or can be dragged and dropped into the page surface. Once on the page it may be moved or sized freely, space permitting. This operation automatically unlocks the layout editing.

- If an object is dragged on top of another, both will turn green showing it is possible to tab them and create a **tabbed** view. Keep a tabbed view pressed to extract an object from the tab an move it separately.

<p align=center> ![3.4-Views-sample](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2FZgXQQKIMYiWdsbeY3Ev0%2F3.4-Views-sample.webp?alt=media&token=987cbbc6-e464-4b00-b016-391e3e386257) </p>

## Layouts {#Layouts-3.5}


- After all pages and views are configured, the layout configuration can be saved into a **Layout** file by tapping the **{VIBE}** Menu and then the **{LAYOUT}** key.

- After configuring new windows on the external monitors, a layout file should be saved to preserve the external monitor layout on reboot. Layout files store the configuration of external monitors and if the system is booted without the expected external monitor a warning message will appear.

- Layout files, containing all the graphical settings of pages and views, are loaded independently from the Show files, containing all the stored data. 

👉 Layout Files are particularly useful when the same desk is managed by different operators; each user can load his own customized layout without losing any show data programmed by the previous user.

### Layout Settings

Layout Settings can be accessed when layout is **Locked**, by tapping the Vibe Menu and then the {Setting} button on the toolbar, near the Lock and Pages buttons. These settings are applied as defaults to all the Pages and Views.

<p align=center> ![3.5-Layout-Settings](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fco6zHjxX7ZVRiO0Ze921%2Fuploads%2F3meZC6vw7u2jpirhGdEf%2F3.5-Layout-Settings.webp?alt=media&token=d0c6e85e-0ac5-40b5-89fa-83e1ff066027) </p>

It is possible to change the Vibe Theme, to move the Toolbar on top or bottom position on all the pages, and to set Default View Settings for the Headers, the Frames and the Scrollbars.
