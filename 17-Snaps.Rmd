## Storing Snaps {#17.1.StoringSnaps}



**Snaps (Snapshots) - Capture and record the current state of all controllers including:**

-   Loaded Qlist
    
-   Current Page - Optional
    
-   Current Master Controller - Optional
    
-   Current active cue
    
-   Slider (Fader) position
    
-   Priority list (stack) at the time of the snapshot
    
-   Controller Priority Group number
    
-   Controller slider and button assignments
    
-   Linked controllers (Combined)
    
-   Rate overrides
    
-   Effect Size overrides
    
-   Effect Offset overrides
    
-   Effect Base overrides
    

**Store a Snapshot:**

1. Make sure that all controllers on **all** pages are setup, loaded, and activated exactly as you want them to be restored.
    
2.  Press [STORE] [HERE] to any available {Snap} softkey. 

Or
    
2. Press [SNAP] [#] [STORE].
    
3.  Press [TEXT] to open the Text Pop-up and label the Snap - this is only valid directly after storing the Snap. Alternately [SNAP] [#] [TEXT] may be used at any time to label the Snap.



## Triggering Snap {#17.2.TriggeringSnap}




Snaps may be directly triggered using the keypad or Snap Softkeys.

**Trigger a Snap using the keypad:**

-   [SNAP] [#] [ENTER]
    

**Trigger a Snap using Snap softkeys:**

-   Tap the required {SNAP} softkey.
    

 <span style="color:Gray">**Trigger a Snap from a Qkey: Currently Unimplemented.**</span> 

-    <span style="color:Gray">Assign the Snap to the Qkey by pressing [SNAP] [#] [HERE] to any Qkey button.</span>
    
-   <span style="color:Gray">Press the Qkey button to activate. </span>
    

Snaps on Vibe are currently **absolute** - All controllers are replaced with new loaded objects and controllers without new loaded objects are cleared. <span style="color:Gray">Future releases will have an option for "Page Holdover" where active objects will not be replaced until the controller is released.</span>

Snaps may be assigned a time to "smooth" out their transitions.

**Setting Snap Time:**

1.  Press [SNAP] [#] [SETTINGS] - The Snap Settings pop-up will appear.
    
2.  Toggle the {Snap Time} key On.
    
3.  Adjust the Snap Time with the Virtual Time Wheel.
    
4.  Close the pop-up using [ENTER] or [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png) .


**Additional Snap Settings:**

-   Snap Label - Enter text label for Snap into the white text box.
    
-   Load Pages - Restores the controllers to the page they were on when the Snap was recorded.
    
-   Load Master PB (Controller) - Restores assignment of the Master Controller to the controller it was assigned to when the Snap was recorded.
    

**Controller Settings Properties that affect Snap:**

-   Exclude from Snap - Controller will not be included when Snaps are recorded.
    
-   Exclude from Override - Even if recorded in a Snap, the controller will ignore Snap activation instructions.


## Attaching Snaps {#17.3.AttachingSnaps}

Snaps may be attached and triggered from Qlist Cues.

**Attach a Snap to a Cue:**

-   [CUE] [#] [SNAP] [#] [RELEASE]
    

**Release all Macros from a Cue:**

-   [CUE] [#] [SNAP] [RLEAEASE]
    

**Snaps are triggered when:**

-   The Qlist is advanced to the cue with the Snap trigger.
    
-   [GOTO] commands are used.
    
-   [CUE] [#] [GO] is used.
    

>Back commands will not trigger Macros or Snap.

**Temporarily disable triggers:**
