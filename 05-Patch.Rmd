## Sets {#Sets-5.1}


Vibe contains an extensive **Device Library** with DMX parameter mapping for fixtures, media servers, and common miscellaneous devices like smoke machines. 
Before a device can be programmed it must be imported and patched to DMX addresses. 

Vibe has an advanced numbering system that allows devices to be grouped into five familiar categories called **SETS**. 

The Default Sets are Fixture, Channel, Spot, Matrix, Media Server. Additional custom **SETS** may also be created. Fixture numbering in all sets can be freely changed if there are no overlapping numbers. Each Set has a unique ID.

**Set ID numbers:** 

  - 0 = **\[Fixture]** is a special global numbering set that must also reference one of the other sets. All devices must be assigned a Fixture number and one of the other set numbers. 

  - 1 = **\[Channel]** is a numbering set that would normally be used for conventional single parameter devices. 

  - 2 = **\[SPOT]** is a numbering set that would mainly be used for multi-parameter devices like moving lights. 

  - 3 = **\[MATRIX]** is a numbering set that would mainly be used for RGB or other non-moving LED fixtures, also useful for pixel mapping devices.

  - 4 = **\[SERVER]** is a numbering system used for media servers.

Each **SET** may have Fixtures numbered from 1 ⟶ 999999 

To patch a device, you must first move focus to the main monitor and press the \[PATCH] Workspace Template key. By default, the first page will contain all the displays needed for patching.

### Add Sets

The option to add a user-created set is done via the Sets view.

**To Add a Set**

1. Add a Sets view: 

- Open _Vibe_ menu

- Tap Patch

- Tap Sets

2. On the Sets view tap the Add icon on the header

3. On the popup define the set's name and number

4. Tap apply

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.1-Sets")`

### Edit Sets

There is an option to edit a user-created set. This is done via the Sets view.

**To Edit a Set**

- Open _Vibe_ menu

- Tap Patch

- Tap Sets

2. On the Sets view select a user-created set

3. Tap the Edit icon on the header


## Devices {#Devices-5.2}


**Once the Patch Page is open:**

1. Use the Devices view.
    
2. Tap {Import}, the Manufactures picker list will appear.
    
`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.2-Devices-Import")`
    
3. Flick or drag along the list to browse to the desired manufacturer then tap the manufacturer's name.
    
4.  A new list and search window will open. If the exact device name is known, type it in the search window, if not flick or drag to browse the list until the desired device is found.
    
`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.2-Devices")`
    
5. The < key may be pressed at any time to return to the imported Devices list.
    
`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.2-Search-Bar")`

### Advanced Search

Fixtures may be searched directly by name using the **Advanced Device Search**. 

Searches may be filtered by parameter order and DMX Channel Count to limit the search. 

👉 The filters are very helpful in finding close matches for fixtures that are not currently in the device library.

**To access Advanced Search:**

1. Tap {Import} on the Devices view header - The tab will show {Advanced Search}.
    
2. Tap {Advanced Search} - The Advanced Search Pop-up will appear.
    
3. Type the fixture's name in the Fixture Name box, set the number of channels, or select the parameters to filters the devices database.
    
4. Select the fixture from the Matching Devices list.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.2-Advanced-Device-Search")`

5. The DMX Modes pop-up will open. 

6. Review the DMX chart and select the desired mode. 

7. Tap Apply or Import or press \[ENTER] to close the popup and add the fixture to the Imported Devices list.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.2-Device-Import-sample")`


## Create and Patch {#Create-and-Patch-5.3}


**To open the Create and Patch popup:**

1. Import the desired device.
    
2. The device will now be in the list below the Imported Devices header.
    
3. Tap the device you wish to patch and the Create and Patch Fixtures popup will appear.
    
`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Create-and-Patch")`

**To Create and Patch fixtures:**

1. In the **Create and Patch** pop-up, type the quantity in the red highlighted field via the keypad or flick/drag to browse the list until the desired quantity number is found then tap the number.
    
2. If the **Quantity** number is not highlighted in <span style="color:Red">Red</span>, tap the field to make it active.
    
3. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap in the {SET} field. The appropriate SET for the selected fixture should automatically be selected, but as some fixtures don't always cleanly fit into standard categories, check that the correct Set is selected. If not, flick/drag to browse to the correct SET then tap it. You may also type the Set number (0-5).
    
4. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the {Set Number} field.
    
5. Set the Channel, Spot, Matrix, or Server number for the fixture in the red highlighted field using the keypad or scroll to browse the list until the desired start number is found, then tap the number. 
👉 By default, the first available number for the selected SET is pre-assigned.
    
6. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any box in the Fixture Number field to select it.
    
7. By default, the same number as the SET Number will appear as the Fixture Number. Many users like to group Fixtures by 10ʼs or 100ʼs so it is common to type 101 for the start of one type of fixture, 201 for a second type and so on. The SET number and Fixture number do not have to be the same.
    
8. Next to the Fixture Number field is a data entry box that displays the fixture's default short name. This may be edited at any time while in this pop-up. The name will be updated when the fixtures are created upon closing the popup.
    
9. In the second section of the pop-up, fixtures that were selected for creation can be patched via the DMX patch wizard. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap a number in the UNIVERSE field. If the desired universe is not visible, flick/drag to browse to the correct universe number then tap it.
    
10. Press the ⟶ key on the keypad to tab to the next field, or tap any number in the **ADDRESS** field.

👉 By default, the interval between fixtures of the same type is fixed.
Using the **INTERVAL** field, a custom interval may be set.

11. To complete **CREATE and PATCH** tap the **{APPLY & CONTINUE}** key in the bottom **right corner of the popup**, Press **\[ENTER]**, or tap Apply to close the popup and return to the patch workspace.

**Theatrical Multi-Patching can also be done manually using keypad syntax:**

  - Toggle off the **{MAIN PATCH}** key at the top of the DMX patch wizard before closing the pop-up. The fixtures will be created but will remain unpatched.

**To Patch fixtures using traditional keypad syntax:**

  - \[FIXTURE] \[#] \[ADDRESS] \[#].\[#] 
  
👉 By default, the first available DMX address of the selected Universe will be shown in the **ADDRESS** field. If the default start address is not appropriate, type or scroll the list to the desired start address and tap it.Universe.Address, \[STORE]. **Or** 

  - \[ADDRESS] \[#].\[#] +/ - ⟶ \[#].\[#] \[FIXTURE] \[#] \[STORE].

👉 Addresses may also be typed in absolute format: 1 ⟶ 32,768 (64 Universes standard). The system will automatically assign the correct universe.
 
👉 When starting from a {New Show} only {Physical DMX outputs} are enabled. Network universes must be enabled in **PATCH** {DMX Settings}

### Drag and Drop Patch

If {Main Patch} is toggled off in the Create and Patch pop-up, fixtures can be created but not patched. Created fixtures may then be dragged and dropped onto the Universe View.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Universe-View")`

**Drag and Drop from the Fixtures tab:**

1. Create fixtures.
    
2. Select the Fixture **Set** you wish to patch from the Set list.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Sets-View")`
    
3. Select a destination **Universe** from the Universes list. The universe grid will be shown in the Universes view.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Universes")`

4. Select the **Fixtures** you wish to patch from the Fixtures list.
👉 Multiple fixtures may be selected by swiping ⤴ or ⤵ in the Fixtures list.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Fixtures")`

5. **Press and Hold** the fixtures, they will turn into floating icons.
    
6. Drag the fixture icons from the Fixtures view onto the Universe View grid. All associated DMX addresses will turn green. Drop the fixture icon on the desired DMX start address

7. The fixtures are now patched.
    
**Make multiple selections of fixtures using the keypad:**

1. Type a range of fixtures using the keypad - the fixture selection will be displayed numerically in the **Selection** box.
    
2.  **Press and Hold** anywhere in the Selection box - a fixture icon will appear.
    
3. Drag the icon to the Universe View grid and drop it at the destination start address.

4. The range of fixtures is now patched.
    
**Multi-Patch using Drag and Drop:**

1. Drag and drop the same fixture to multiple DMX offsets.
    
👉 All types of fixtures may be multi-patched but caution should be used when multi-patching multi-parameter fixtures.

**Unpatch fixtures using drag and drop:**

1. **Press and Hold** any patched DMX offset - The DMX addresses for the fixtures patched to it will turn green and a fixture icon will be shown.
    
2. Drag the selected block of fixtures towards the bottom of the screen - a waste bin icon will appear.
    
3. Drag the block until the icon is over the waste bin and drop the fixtures.

4. The fixtures are now unpatched.  

### Modify Patch

Once patched fixtures can be modified using keypad syntax or using the **Patch Toolbar**.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Patch-Toolbar")`

  - {CLEAR PATCH} - Opens the Clear Patch popup. 
    
  - {DELETE FIXTURE} - Opens the Delete Fixtures popup.

  - {CLONE} - Opens the Fixture Cloning popup.

  - {REPLACE} - Opens the Device Replacement popup.

  - {ADD FIXTURE} - Opens the Create And Patch popup. 
  
  - {PATCH} - Opens the Patch Fixture popup. 
  
  - {RENUMBER} - Opens the Renumber Fixture popup. 

  - {AUTO GENERATE} - Opens the Auto Generate popup. 
  
  - {FIXTURE CALIBRATION} - Opens the Fixture Calibration popup. 
  
**Modify the patch using keypad syntax:** 

  - \[FIXTURE] \[#] {CLEAR PATCH} - From the Editor toolbar. 

  - \[FIXTURE] \[#] \[DELETE] - Only works in the Patch Page.
    
### Address Test

Sometimes, especially in theatrical environments, it is useful to check if a DMX channel is empty or not. This can be done from the console by enabling the Address Test function on the header of the Universe View.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.3-Address-Test")`

In Address Test mode each selected channel is visualized with a yellow background and it is forced to jump at full intensity.

Many channels can be selected by dragging or through multiple touches.

\[RESET] releases the channels and disables the Address Test function.

Once the function is disabled all the channels come back to their normal state.


## DMX Properties {#DMX-Properties-5.4}


By default, DMX is mapped to the physical ports on a 1:1 basis. 

DMX can be remapped to anyone of the supported 256 DMX universes.

### Local Output

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.4-DMX-Settings-Local")`

**Remap Local Outputs:**

1. Open the {DMX SETTINGS} from Vibe Menu > Settings or tap the DMX Settings button - The DMX Properties popup will open.
    
2. In the Protocol column, Tap {Local Output}.
    
3. Under the Source Universe heading, tap the desired source universe number or once red type the universe number you wish to be the source.
    
4. Under the Local Output Destination Universe heading, tap one of the displayed local outputs - the source Universe will now be patched to the output.
    
**Change output to input** 

- Currently Vibe supports 2 inputs but multiple connectors may be assigned to the same input.

1. Tap a patched output - Two additional options will light up near the Output Destination Universe box. 

  - {Make Input 1} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 1. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input. 

  - {Make Input 2} - Makes the selected outputs into Input 2. The Physical connector display will turn white to indicate it is now an input.
    
**Change input back to output:**

1. Tap a patched input - an additional Make Output option will light up near the Output Destination Universe box.
    
2. Tap {Make Output} - The Connector will now output DMX.
    
**Change DMX refresh rate:**

Sometimes older equipment cannot handle the higher refresh rates, so it may be reduced with the DMX Max Rate wheel. It is not recommended to go below 28Hz as some flickering may be observed.

### VC

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.4-DMX-Settings-VCs")`

### ArtNet

><span style="color:Red">> The Grandmaster **does not** affect parked addresses and fixtures. </span>

><span style="color:Red">> The \[B.O.] key **does** blackout parked addresses and fixtures. </span>


## Clone {#Clone-5.8}


Vibe has smart and advanced clone features.

The Fixture Cloning feature allows to copy all the stored data from a selection of fixtures to another one.

To open the fixture cloning popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page's Editor Toolbar.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.8-Clone-Fixture")`

Choose the order of source fixtures on the left column and the order of destination fixtures on the right column, then press Done.

Vibe will provide a smart fixture cloning keeping the fixtures' data as similar as possible.

Selection Rules:

- All source fixtures must be of the same type.

- All destination fixtures must be of the same type.

- Many fixtures can be cloned to many fixtures, but the amount must be the same.

- It is possible to select 1 source and many destinations.

The fixture cloning operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button.

**Exchange Clone**

The Cloning option on the top can be set as a one sided or a two-sided clone.

A one-sided clone copies the stored data from the source to the destination fixtures only.

A two-sided clone, called Exchange Clone, makes a smart replacement of data from the source fixtures to the destination fixtures and vice versa.

**Advanced Clone**

The Advanced fixture cloning option on the top enables access to a pair of Next popup windows where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced, and customized by the user.

The next step shows the Parameter Selection window.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.8-Clone-Param")`

The cloning can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters' levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture's functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart.

On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart.

The next step shows the Data window.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.8-Clone-Data")`

The Data window permits to filter the Groups, Libraries, Qlists, Scenes and Submasters, to apply the cloning only to the selected contents. Default is that all are selected.

NOTE: on the exchange option, these lists will show objects from both source and destination fixtures.

There is an option to clone the calibration data, so the destination fixture will get the same location coordinates as the source fixture. Default is Disabled, because in real world 2 fixtures cannot have the same physical position, but can be enabled, for example in case of fixture switches or if working on a 3D visualizer trying different lighting setups on the same rig.

There is an option to clone the look ahead mask so if the source fixture is in the mask, then the destination fixtures will also be in the mask. Default is Enabled.

There is an option to choose what to do with the parameters of the destination fixtures that are not included in the clone because they were not matched or any other reason. Merge means to keep these values, overwrite will delete the values. Default is Overwrite.


## Replace {#Replace-5.9}


Vibe has smart and advanced device replacement.

The Device replacement feature allows to replace a device with another one, keeping all the matching data stored.

To open the device replacement popup, press the dedicated button in Patch page's Editor Toolbar.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.9-Replace-Fixture")`

Choose the Source device on the left column and the new device from the Imported Devices on the right column, then press Done.

Vibe will provide a smart device replacement keeping the fixtures' data as similar as possible.

The device replacement operation is not reversible, so there is no undo once hitting the DONE button.

**Advanced Replacement**

The Advanced replacement option on the top enables access to a Next popup window where the matching parameters can be filtered, forced and customized by the user.

The next step shows the Parameter Selection window.

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.9-Replace-Param")`

Each bank has its option to enable/disable. Enabled means it will be included in the Device replacement and disabled means it will not be included. Default is enabled.

The replacement can be based on raw values, preserving the parameters' levels, or on smart values, preserving the fixture's functions. Raw values means that Vibe will match between parameter types and copy the raw value. Smart means that Vibe will try to find the real data information of the parameter and convert the values to match the destination fixture to look the same. Default is Smart.

On the right side there is a match table between the source and destination fixtures parameters. This table is dynamic and shows the data set from the left side. User can also change matching parameters manually, but this is only to very special cases and anyway it is not recommended. SMART will anyway overrule the table in case there is a parameter that is included in the smart.


## Calibration {#Calibration-5.10}


{Fixture Calibration} key on the Patch Toolbar opens a popup used to calibrate the fixtures through the XYZ coordinates, either taken from a 3D Visualizer or from a real measurement. 

When fixtures are properly calibrated it is possible to specify a stage point on Vibe xyz position picker to automatically point all the fixtures on it. 

Another advantage of the fixture calibration is to speed up the creation of topographical views (Topo).

There are few passages to get the calibration data of the fixtures from third party software, that depend on which visualizer is used. 

### Wysiwyg

1.  On Vibe, go to \[PATCH] page and tap on {FIXTURE CALIBRATION}.
    
2.  Tap on {Stage} button and set the stage dimensions.
    
3.   Specify the drawing origin point at the center of the stage. For this, it will be necessary to work in the CAD tab using the TOP view. Press on the top left corner (that connects the vertical ruler and the horizontal ruler – (see <span style="color:LightSkyBlue">Blue Frame</span>), and select the option of 'Mover Ruler (Set View Origin)ʼ.
    
4.  Select the center of your stage (see <span style="color:Red">Red Arrow</span> in the Picture)
    
`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.10-Wysiwyg-Calibration")`

5. Go to 'Data tab', press Option on the toolbar ⟶  Document Options ⟶  Draw Defaults - and  change the units to metric..

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.10-Wysiwyg-Calibration-Data")`

6. Copy these values (manually) to the Fixture calibration table in Vibe:

  - the column X to the column X, 

  - the column Y to the column Y, 

  - the column Z to the column Z.

7. After all values are in the Vibe fixture calibration table, select the X column (by tapping the header) and press \[-]. 

8. Fixtures are now calibrated.

### Capture

1. On Vibe, go to \[PATCH] page and tap on {FIXTURE CALIBRATION}.
    
2. Tap on {Stage} button and set the stage dimensions.
    
3. Place the center of the stage in the intersect point of the 2 Bold Axis, when the CAD displays a view from the Top

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.10-Capture-Calibration")`

4. Go to Tools ⟶  Options and change the measurements to metric.

5. Select a fixture in Capture to see the XYZ coordinates when the table is showing 'Selected Itemsʼ. 

`r create_image_tag("05.Patch", "5.10-Capture-Calibration-Data")`

6. Copy these values (manually) to the Fixture calibration table in Vibe:

  - the column X to the column X, 

  - the column Y to the column Z, 

  - the column Z to the column Y.

7. After all values are in the Vibe fixture calibration table, select the X column (by tapping the header) and press \[-], and select the Y column and press \[-]. 

8. Fixtures are now calibrated.
