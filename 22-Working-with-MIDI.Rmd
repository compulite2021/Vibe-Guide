## What is MIDI

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that was originally developed by the music industry to allow multiple MIDI sound devices to be triggered from just one source, usually a master keyboard or synthesizer. It is a control protocol and does not transmit audio. Over the years the MIDI protocol has evolved to also be a popular way to synchronize and "Play" lighting equipment. MIDI is based around a 7-bit architecture and therefore has a theoretical 127 possible notes for a keyboard. (Most pianos use 88 notes and synthesizers use even less)

**In the basic MIDI implementation it is possible to have:**

-   16 independent MIDI channels - The channels systems listen on.
    
-   127 Note ONs - Pressing down on a keyboard.
    
-   127 Note OFFs - Lifting off a keyboard.
    
-   Note On Velocity of 1 ⟶  127 - How hard the key is struck.
    
-   After Touch pressure of 0 ⟶  127 - Ho muce pressure is applied after the key reaches the bottom.
    
-   127 controllers each with a range of 0 ⟶ 127 - Encoder wheels or faders.
    
-   Patch changes from 0 ⟶   127 - change from one instrument to another.
    
-   Pitch bend wheel that has a 14-bit resolution.
    
-   A section for MIDI time code, and other manufacturer's "System Exclusive" information. In lighting, we often assign matching notes and controllers to common keys and wheels to synchronize playback.


>E.g. A GO Button on console A is configured to send Note #46, and a GO button on console B is configured to receive note #46. Pressing GO on console A console will press the GO on console B. In EDM shows, DJ's frequently control lighting via MIDI touchpad controllers.

**MIDI Show Control or MSC -** <span style="color:blue">Not yet implemented</span>

-   is a significant Real Time System Exclusive extension of the international Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. MSC enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control.
    
-   The MIDI Show Control protocol is an industry standard ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in 1991 which allows all types of entertainment control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications. Just like musical MIDI, MSC does not transmit the actual show media - it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance.. * Courtesy Wikipedia
    

**MIDI Time Code** - <span style="color:blue">Not yet implemented</span>

-   MIDI time code is similar to the SMPTE time code and is used to synchronize audio, video, and lighting equipment. Unlike SMPTE it does not use an audio signal.
    
-   MIDI time code is available in the following frame rates: 

    ◾ 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work) 

    ◾ 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video) 

    ◾ 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video) 

    ◾ 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video)
    

>Vibe can receive MIDI time code but does not generate MIDI time code.

**Local MIDI:**

-   MIDI is generated and received from the 5 pin DIN connectors on the back of the console.
    

**MIDI over USB:**

-   Transmits and receives MIDI over standard USB connectors. The device must be MIDI over USB class compliant to work with Windows without a driver. If the device has a Windows driver available it is recommended to install the driver for optimal results.
    

**MIDI over Ethernet:**

-   Windows class compliant MIDI over Ethernet is supported. Compulite VC MIDI over Ethernet is also supported.

3.  Press Apply to stay in I/O settings or Press the [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png)  or press [ENTER] to close the pop-up.



## Configuring MIDI Notes and Commands



**MIDI Notes and Commands:**

-   The numbers 0 ⟶  127 on the MIDI grid represent 10 3/4 octaves of notes from C-0 ⟶ G-10.
    
-   Tabs at the bottom filter the type of MIDI message to be received.
    
-   Channel # may also be selected to filter just messages being received on the selected channel.
    

>The MIDI grid is used to select any of the 127 values available for the MIDI message types selected with the tabs.

## MIDI Show Control


Midi Show Control was developed as a simple standard method of triggering basic commands on dissimilar devices. Basic MSC commands are:

-   Go
    
-   Stop
    
-   Fire - Generally used for macros
    

Also supported on **receive** are:

-   All fixtures
    
-   General lights
    
-   Moving lights

To receive MSC:

1.  Tap {Enable In}
    
2.   Match the {Device #} to number of the peer that will be sending the control commands.
    
3.  If the Peer # is above 111, select a Group # that matches and all devices set to that Group # will receive MSC packets.
    
4.   If the Peer # is 127 (Broadcast Mode) packets will be received on all devices regardless of their Device or Group numbers. To Transmit MSC: This function is currently under development.
