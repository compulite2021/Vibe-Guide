## Look Ahead (Move in Dark)


15.1. Look Ahead (Move in Dark)

The Look Ahead feature is used for automatic pre-positioning of selected parameters when the fixture's dimmer is dark, thus avoiding visible p r meter movement. For Look Ahead to work, the fixture's dimmer must be at ZR, and there must be a parameter moves from one cue to the next cue. Look Ahead fades can be set for a specified default time or user time, which is different than the cue's default fade time. Before using Look Ahead, you must create a Look Ahead mask. The Look Ahead mask tells Vibe which spots, spot parameters, or scrollers are affected by the Look Ahead feature. If you have not specified parameters in the Look Ahead mask, all parameters will be affected. The Look Ahead mask can contain more than one parameter. Currently, the Look Ahead pre-positioning will happen at the **last** available opportunity before the dimmer turns on.

</span>

**Enable or Disable Look Ahead on all controllers:**

1. Open System Settings from the Vibe Menu or tap the status area of the main monitor - The System Settings pop-up will open.
    
2.  Tap the {Timing} tab to open the Timing Properties pop-up.
    
3.  Under the **Look Ahead** header enable or disable all controllers using {Set All Controllers ON} or {Set All Controllers OFF}.
    
4. There is no confirmation of On/Off as these buttons basically toggle {Look Ahead} in **all** Qlist Properties pop-ups.
    
5.   If Look Ahead is globally turned off it may still be enabled on a per Qlist basis in the Qlist Properties pop-up.

>Look Ahead status for individual controllers may be viewed in the controller's Qlist Properties.


**Create the Look Ahead Mask:**

1.  Select the fixtures to be in the Mask.
    
2.  Optionally select the parameters to be included in the Mask - If no parameters are selected, all parameters will be included.
    
3.  Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar.
    
4.  Press [STORE].
    

**Delete the Look Ahead Mask:**

1.  Select the fixtures to be deleted from the Mask.
    
2.  Tap {LOOK AHEAD MASK} on the Editor Toolbar.
    
3.   Press [DELETE].
    

A Look Ahead cue is a cue that automatically pre-positions parameters when the dimmer is off. Currently only time can be set for a Look Ahead cue. **Set individual Look Ahead Time -** Speed at which fixtures move in dark.

1.  CUE] [#] [Time] - The Time pop-up will open.
    
2.  Tap {Look Ahead} - The indicator will turn green and Look Ahead will appear over the virtual time wheel.
    
3.  Set the time value using the virtual wheel or type the value directly on the keypad.
    
4.  Press [Enter] or tap <img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/> to close the pop-up and store the Look Ahead time.
    

>Look Ahead time can also be changed using the [CUE ] [#] [SETTINGS] command. Default Look Ahead time can be set in System Settings/Defaults/Cue Settings.

**Enable or Disable Look Ahead on individual controllers:**

1.  Press [SETTINGS] [HERE] to any controller button of the controller you wish to enable or disable Look Ahead on - The Settings pop-up will open.
    
2.  Tap the {Qlist properties} tab - The Qlist Properties pop-up will open.
    
3.  Toggle Look Ahead on or off.
    
4.  Press [Enter] or tap <img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/> to close the pop-up.



## Look Ahead Cue (Mark)


**Unimplemented**

-   Look Ahead: (sometimes referred to a Mark Cue) 

    â—¾ Unlike having Look Ahead automatically preposition all dark parameters for all cues in a Qlist, a cue tagged in Cue Store **Options** as {Look Ahead} will preposition dark parameters for just the tagged cue.



## Force Black



When it is not desirable to see parameter values move from one cue state to another, Force Black may be used to save programing time. In a cue flagged as Force Black, the dimmer parameter is first "forced" to Black Out, parameters them move in black, then the dimmer parameter is faded up again. The total speed of a Force Black operation is relative to the overall cue time.

**To flag a cue as a Force Black Cue:**

1.  [QLIST [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS].
    
2.  Toggle {Force Black} On - The indicator will turn green and the cue will be flagged as a Force Black cue.
    
3.  Press [Enter] or tap [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png)  to close the pop-up.
    

**To remove a Force Black flag:**

1.  [QLIST [#] (if not on Master Controller) [CUE] [#] [SETTINGS].
    
2. Toggle {Force Black} Off - The indicator will turn off and the cue will no longer act as a Force Black cue.
    
3.  Press [Enter] or tap [<img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F3kS90tLsADGm1ocbe7q9%2Fuploads%2F6EE8U1Wvt91iKCQ8V0Na%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=896910e2-8a35-4b58-b0fe-3602ba6f5411.png" width="30"/>](image.png) to close the pop-up.
