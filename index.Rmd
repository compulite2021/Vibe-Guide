## Important Terms {#Important-Terms-1.4}


-   **DMX 512 Output/Input Port** - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter.
    
-   **DMX 512 Universe** - Virtual DMX outputs 0 ‚ü∂ 256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols. 

    ‚óæ Compulite VC protocol 

    ‚óæ w Art-Net 3 w 

    ‚óæ sACN
    
-   **SET** = Fixture numbering syste 
    - 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets) 
    - 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures)
    - 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors) 
    - 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures) 
    - 4 = Servers (Video servers) 
    - 5 ‚ü∂ 1000 = User defined sets
    
-   **Parameter** - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo.
    
-   **Controllers** - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots.
    
-   **Submaster** - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value.
    
-   **Master Controller** - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys.
    
-   **Slider** - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a **Fader**.
    
-   **Qkey** - A single button Controller.
    
-   **Assert** - Takes back control of parameters that have been "robbed" by other controllers.
    
-   **HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence)** - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications.
    
-   **LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence)** - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output it's values to the stage no matter what the value.
    
-   **[SELECT]** - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller.
    
-   **Qlist** - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999.
    
-   **Cue** - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values **and** properties such as text label and time values.
    
-   **Scene** - A look that exists independent of a Qlist.

-   **Options** - Used to modify object properties "on the fly".
    
-   **Settings** - Used to modify object properties and behaviors **after** an object has been created.
    
-   **Cue Zero** - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid.
    

>üëâ For the sake of this guide, **Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets** will be referred to as **Fixture** because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets

>üëâ Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function.

- Re-Selecting fixture and applying library did not keep the order

- Free All could not work if one of the playbacks had "exclude from paging"

- Playback leds were blinking even if fade ended on some occasions

- Dimmer wheel changing value only for first parameter on fixtures with many dimmers.

- Dragging fixtures that their patch size is 1 to the universe view did not work

- In some cases output and CITP was not working

- Master Slave:

	- Disconnect button on settings popup logic changed

	- Disconnection cleanup fixes

	- Added small progress to disconnect process

	- Master-Slave sync did not sync images folder

	- Disconnect after unexpected crash

	- Master-Slave false disconnect detection fixed

	- Reconnect or false detection of disconnection could cause Slave to get stuck

	- After connecting to master, all async calls did not work

	- Sync lpu refresh depends on console state

	- Fixed images sync that image did not appear

	- Images sync did not work if slave did not have images folder before the sync

	- Fixed an issue when messages could get corrupted when receiving them in IPC

	- Fixed Crashes when switching to master but not connecting to a partner and then settings protect/topo image

	- Fixed protect images resetting to default on systemSettingsPopup open

	- Added Master standby state to differentiate between master with partner and master without partner

	- Fixed lpu's not connecting after network cut lpu crash

	- Fixed reconnect issues

	- Sometimes when recovering from crash or reconnect, the partner IP was not set right
	
	- Stuck or crashed on sync if show file size was big

- Fixture Builder
	
	- When there are collisions in steps values it does not popup a message
	
	- Unsupported notes are now disabled
	
	- Add a step after renaming a step will not rename the step name.
	
	- Changing the text in the text boxes is sometimes not saved
	
	- When you create more than 1 mode while Vibe is running, it writes next to one mode a huge number of fixtures
	
	- When adding color or position params it should automatically create the virtual params
	
	- When Fixture builder is opened via Vibe, touching the smart screen will stuck the system.
	
	- Edit a mode that is not the first on the list using the fixture builder from the Vibe cause a crash to the fixture builder

	- Changing home/empty/highlight/lowlight values in fixture builder did not fix it in the existing fixtures
	
	- Fix crash on store from EditDeviceTab
- Vector Show conversion
	
	- If vector show was in Fixture mode, then the fixture numbers on Vibe are incorrect
	
	- When auto converting Vector device to vibe the empty value of the dimmer is not right
	
	- If Vector device had empty parameter vibe did not consider it in the convert match process
	
	- If vector external patch was together with channel patch vibe did not patch converted show
	
	- Vector device match was wrong after first conversion
	
	- Vector convert did not take the look ahead mask correctly
	
	- Converting Vector libraries was wrong if the library had a value from another library (nested on Vector)
	
	- Did not take the invert property for parameters if the device was taken from the exiting Vibe devices
	
	- Blade parameters did not convert correctly from Vector shows
	
	- Also showed devices that had no fixtures in the show
	
	- Added more devices to the auto convert inventory
	
	- Highlight and Lowlight cues were not converted correctly
	
	- Could make a mix of parameter type indexes if certain types were in the device
