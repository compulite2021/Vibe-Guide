## Start Up {#Start-Up-1.1}


**Power requirements:**

- Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz.
- Approximately power consumption is 3.2A at 230V.
- Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector, or IEC C13 connector on the Vibey, ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country.

**Desk Light:**

- Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console.
- Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. 

**Monitor intensity:**

- Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. 

**Power up the console:**

- Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks.
- Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector.
- Press the Power button located at the upper corner of the monitor panel.
- The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch.

**Power down the console:**

- Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open.
- Tap {Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} popup will appear.
- Tap {Yes} or {No} to save or not the current show file.

-   **HardKey** - Any physical button on the console or its virtual equivalent on the screen.

-   **SoftKey** - Any virtual button on the screen that corresponds to a stored element such as libraries, groups, qlists, scenes, macros, and snaps.

-   **Set** = Fixture numbering system 
    - 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets) 
    - 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures)
    - 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors) 
    - 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures) 
    - 4 = Servers (Video servers) 
    - 5 ⟶ 1000 = User defined sets

-   **Fixture** - An independent object controlled by the console thorough DMX or network protocol, such as a conventional or LED luminaire, a moving head, or a media server. 

-   **Parameter** - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo wheel.

-   **Bank** - A group of features of a fixture such as intensity, position, color, beam, image and shape.

-   **Encoder** - A physical or virtual wheel used to control the values of the fixtures' parameters.

-   **Editor** - The part of the system that is used to program the fixtures and store the objects.

-   **Playback** - The part of the system that is used to play the fixtures by triggering the stored objects.

-   **Controller** - Any physical or virtual control element that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots.

-   **Black Out** - A physical or virtual button that inhibits the dimmer values of every fixture bringing them at 0%, often referred to as a **B.O.**.

-   **Grand Master** - A physical or virtual control element that inhibits the dimmer values of every fixture, proportionate to their assigned value.

-   **Submaster** - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values, proportionate to their assigned value.

-   **Master Controller** - Main playback section of the console with large \[GO], \[BACK], \[HOLD] keys. There can be only one Master Controller, but it can be assigned to any controller.

-   **Playback Master** - A controller that is mastering other controllers.

-   **Cue** - A record contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values.

-   **Cue Zero** - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid.

-   **Scene** - A record that has the same properties of a Cue but exists independently from a Qlist.

-   **Library** - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced.

-   **Options** - Used to modify object properties "on the fly".

-   **Settings** - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created.


>👉 For the sake of this guide, **Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets** will be referred to as **Fixture** because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets.

>👉 Some keys have two functions when used with the \[VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and the top label is the shifted function.
