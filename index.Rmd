## Unboxing

TBA.

## Getting Started
Power requirements:

- Vibe uses a power supply that supports 90-264V at 47-63 Hz.
- Approximately 3.2 amps at 230V.
- Input uses a Neutrik powerCON connector ended with the appropriate male connector for the destination country.

Desk Light:

- Insert the goose neck desk light into the 3 pin XLR on the rear of the console.
- Desk light intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. 

Monitor intensity:
- Monitor intensity is controlled in the {System Settings} {Hardware} tab. 

Power up the console:

- Insert the supplied powerCON male connector into the female connector located on the rear of the console. Align the guide slots and turn clockwise untill the connector locks.
- Turn on the power supply switch above the powerCON connector.
- Press the Power button located at the upper right corner of the monitor panel above the USB connectors.
- The operating system will boot and the Vibe console software will automatically launch.

Power down the console:

- Tap the {Vibe} menu key beside the command line on the main display - The Vibe Menu will open.
- Tap {‚èª Exit} - The {Exit Vibe} Pop-up will appear.
- Tap {Yes} or {No}.
- The Vibe application will shutdown and a screen will appear with the following options:
{Shut Down the Console} - System will power off

{Open Offline Tool} - the Vibe utilities app will open. Hardware and software updates are preformed in the Offline Tools app.
Choose Shut Down the Console - The console will safely power off.

- **[Here]** - Short form for Press an appropriate destination softkey or controller button to complete the command

## Important Terms


-   **DMX 512 Output/Input Port** - One of the 8 physical 5 pin XLR connectors on the back of the console. Although the gender is female, any connector may be configured as an input but must use a turnaround adapter.
    
-   **DMX 512 Universe** - Virtual DMX outputs 0 ‚û°Ô∏è 256 that may be routed to the 8 physical outputs and/or any of the three supported DMX over Ethernet protocols.

-   **SET** = Fixture numbering syste 0 = Fixtures, (Default, includes all sets), 1 = Channels (Conventional fixtures), 2 = Spots (Automated heads and mirrors), 3 = Matrix (LED pixel-based fixtures), 4 = Servers (Video servers), 5 ‚û°Ô∏è 1000 = User defined sets
    
-   **Parameter** - An individual feature of a fixture such as dimmer, pan, tilt, color wheel, gobo.
    
-   **Controllers** - Any physical or virtual control that executes or plays back system objects such as cues, scenes, macros, and snapshots.
    
-   **Submaster** - A special type of Scene where stored fixtures inhibit their dimmer values proportionate to their assigned slider controller value.
    
-   **Master Controller** - Playback section of the console with large [GO], [BACK], [HOLD] keys.
    
-   **Slider** - Slide potentiometer often referred to as a Fader.
    
-   **Qkey** - A single button Controller.
    
-   **Assert** - Takes back control of parameters that have been "robbed" by other controllers.
    
-   **HTP (Highest-Takes-Precedence)** - When values from two or more controllers are summed, The highest value will output to the stage. Used mainly for dimmer values in theater applications.
    
-   **LTP (Latest-Takes-Precedence)** - When similar parameters are on two or more controllers, the last asserted parameter will output it's values to the stage no matter what the value.
    
-   **[SELECT]** - Multi-use key, mainly used to assign any controller as the Master Controller. Commands not specifying a Qlist destination will be applied directly to the [SELECT] Master Controller.
    
-   **Qlist** - A Folder containing cues. Each Qlist has its own unique numbering system from 0.001 to 999.999.
    
-   **Cue** - A look (record) contained within a Qlist. Cues contain stored parameter values and properties such as text label and time values.
    
-   **Scene** - A look that exists independent of a Qlist.
    
-   **Library** - Container of frequently used fixture parameter values (Bank Library) or system objects (Object Library) . Bank Libraries may be created as referenced or unreferenced. The default for most libraries is referenced.
    
-   **Options** - Used to modify object properties "on the fly"
    
-   **Settings** - Used to modify object properties and behaviors after an object has been created.
    
-   **Cue Zero** - The starting point at the top of a Qlist. Release may or may not return to the top of a Qlist depending on Qlist Properties. Cue Zero will always return to the top of the Qlist. The command Cue 0 GOTO is valid.
    

For the sake of this guide, **Channel, Spot, Matrix, and Server Sets** will be referred to as Fixture because the Fixture Set can reference all the other sets

Some keys have two functions when used with the [VIBE] key (shift key). In this case, the key label on the bottom is the default, and top label is the shifted function.
