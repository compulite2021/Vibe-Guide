`r create_image_tag("20.FixtureBuilder", "20.1-Fixture-Builder")`

Fixture Devices may be created, imported and exported through the Fixture Builder.

Fixture Builder can be launched either from the Vibe Menu or from the OS programs.

It's highly recommended to keep Vibe software closed while the Offline Tool is running. 
If launched from Vibe, this operation will be automatically done.

If launching the Fixture Builder from the Vibe, a popup will ask if it has to be opened in Console or in Show mode:

- Console Mode - All the devices contained into the console's device database will be listed.

- Show Mode - Only the devices imported into the current Vibe show will be listed.
